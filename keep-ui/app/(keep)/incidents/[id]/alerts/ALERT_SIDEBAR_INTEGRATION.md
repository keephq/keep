# AlertSidebar Integration in Incident Alerts

## Overview
This implementation replaces the `ViewAlertModal` component with the `AlertSidebar` component in the incident alerts page to provide a consistent user experience across the application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Component Integration (`incident-alerts.tsx`)
- **Removed**: `ViewAlertModal` import and usage
- **Added**: `AlertSidebar` component from `@/features/alerts/alert-detail-sidebar`
- **Updated State Management**:
  - Replaced `viewAlertModal` state with `selectedAlert` and `isSidebarOpen`
  - Added `isIncidentSelectorOpen` state for AlertSidebar compatibility

### 2. User Interactions
The AlertSidebar can be opened in two ways:
1. **Row Click**: Clicking on any alert row in the table
2. **View Button**: Clicking the "View Details" button in the action tray

### 3. Key Features
- **Consistent UI**: Uses the same sidebar component as the main alerts table
- **Alert Details**: Shows alert name, severity, description, source, and other metadata
- **Alert Timeline**: Displays audit history and state changes
- **Related Services**: Shows topology map of related services
- **Actions**: Supports workflow execution, status changes, and incident association

### 4. Code Comments
Added explanatory comments in the implementation:
- Component replacement rationale
- State management explanations
- Handler function descriptions
- Optional prop documentation

## Testing

### Test Coverage (`incident-alerts-sidebar.test.tsx`)
Created comprehensive tests covering:
1. **Rendering**: Verifies alerts are displayed correctly
2. **Opening Sidebar**: Tests both row click and button click methods
3. **Closing Sidebar**: Ensures proper cleanup
4. **Alert Switching**: Tests switching between different alerts
5. **Empty State**: Handles no alerts scenario
6. **Loading State**: Covers data fetching states

### Running Tests
```bash
cd keep-ui
npm test -- --testPathPattern="incident-alerts-sidebar.test.tsx"
```

## Benefits
1. **Consistency**: Same sidebar experience across all alert views
2. **Feature Parity**: All alert actions available in incident context
3. **Maintainability**: Single component to maintain instead of multiple modals
4. **User Experience**: Familiar interaction patterns for users

## Future Considerations
- The sidebar supports additional features like workflow execution and status changes
- These features can be enabled by passing the appropriate handlers as props
- The component is designed to be extensible for future requirements
