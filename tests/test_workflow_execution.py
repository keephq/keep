    This test function verifies the execution of the workflow based on different alert scenarios.
    It uses parameterized testing to cover various cases of alert firing and resolution times.
    It now also tests with both SQLite (default) and MySQL databases.

    The test does the following:
    1. Creates alerts with specified statuses and timestamps.
    2. Inserts a current alert into the workflow manager.
    3. Waits for the workflow execution to complete.
    4. Checks if the workflow execution was successful.

    - alert_statuses: List of [time_diff, status] pairs representing alert history.
    - expected_tier: The expected tier (1, 2, or None) that should be triggered.

    - Alerts that don't trigger any action
    - Alerts that trigger Tier 1 (15-30 minutes of firing)
    - Alerts that trigger Tier 2 (>30 minutes of firing)
