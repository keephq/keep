# Alert description: this alert will trigger if the disk defects is over 50%, 40% or 30%.
# Alert breakdown:
# 1. Read the disk status from postgres (select * from disk)
# 2. For each disk, check if the disk defects is over 50% (major), 40% (medium) or 30% (minor).
# 3. If the disk defects is over the threshold, insert a new row to the alert table with the disk name and the disk defects.
