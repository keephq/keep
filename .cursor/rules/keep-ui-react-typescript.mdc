You are an expert in TypeScript, React, Next.js, SWR, Tailwind, and UX design.

# Achitecture
Use Feature-Slice Design Convention with modification: instead of `pages` and `app` we use default Next.js route-based folder structure.

Example:
- entities/
  - incidents/
    - api/
    - lib/
    - model/
    - ui/

Top-level folders, called Layers: 
- widgets
- features
- entities
- shared

Each layer has segments, e.g. "entities/users".

Each segment has slices 
- ui — everything related to UI display: UI components, date formatters, styles, etc.
- api — backend interactions: request functions, data types, mappers, etc.
- model — the data model: schemas, interfaces, stores, and business logic.
- lib — library code that other modules on this slice need.
- config — configuration files and feature flags.

# Code Style and Structure
- Write TypeScript with proper typing for all new code
- Use functional programming patterns; avoid classes
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Don't use `useEffect` where you can use ref function for dom-dependent things (e.g. ref={el => ...})
- Don't use `useState` where you can infer from props
- Use named exports; avoid default exports
- If you need to create new base component, first look at existing ones in `@/shared/ui`

# Naming Conventions
- Always look around the codebase for naming conventions, and follow the best practices of the environment (e.g. use `camelCase` variables in JS).
- Use clear, yet functional names (`searchResults` vs `data`).
- React components are PascalCase (`IncidentList`).
- Props for components and hooks are PascalCase and end with `Props`, e.g. `WorkflowBuilderWidgetProps`, return value for hooks is PascalCase and end with `Value`, e.g. `UseIncidentActionsValue` 
- Name the `.ts` file according to its main export: `IncidentList.ts` or `IncidentList.tsx` or `useIncidents.ts`. Pay attention to the case.
- Avoid `index.ts`, `styles.css`, and other generic names, even if this is the only file in a directory.

# Data Fetching
- Use useSWR for fetching data, create or extend hooks in @/entities/<entity>/model/use<Entity>.ts which encapsulates fetching logic
- Create a dedicated keys file @/entities/<entity>/lib/<entity>Keys.ts to manage SWR cache keys. Structure it as an object with methods for different operations:
```export const entityKeys = {
  all: "entityName",
  list: (query: QueryParams) => [...],
  detail: (id: string) => [...],
  getListMatcher: () => (key: any) => boolean
}```
- For query-based endpoints, construct cache keys by joining parameters with "::", filtering out falsy values:
```list: (query: QueryParams) => [
  entityKeys.all,
  "list",
  query.param1,
  query.param2
].filter(Boolean).join("::")```
- For create, update, delete actions:
  - Create or extend hook in @/entities/<entity>/model/use<Entity>Actions.ts
  - Create a dedicated revalidation hook (e.g., use<Entity>Revalidation.ts) to handle cache invalidation
  - Revalidate both specific items and list queries after mutations
  - Include success/error toast notifications for user feedback
  - Handle file uploads and other complex operations within the actions hook

# UI and Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS as primary styling solution
- For non-Tailwind cases:
  - Use CSS with component-specific files
  - Namespace under component class (.DropdownMenu)
  - Follow BEM for modals (.DropdownMenu__modal)
  - Import styles directly (import './DropdownMenu.css')
- Replace custom CSS with Tailwind when possible
