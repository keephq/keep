## Implementing new strategy

To create a new throttle strategy, create a new class that inherits from `base_throttle.py`, and implements `check_throttling`.

[You can also just submit a new feature request](https://github.com/keephq/keep/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.md&title=feature:%20new%20throttling%20strategy) and we will get to it ASAP!
