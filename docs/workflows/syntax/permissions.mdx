# Permissions

Permissions in Keep Workflow Engine define **who can execute a workflow manually**.

They allow you to restrict access to workflows based on user roles or specific email addresses, ensuring that only authorized users can trigger sensitive workflows.

---

## General Structure

Permissions are defined at the top level of a workflow YAML file using the `permissions` field, which accepts a list of roles and/or email addresses.

```yaml
workflow:
  id: sensitive-workflow
  name: Sensitive Workflow
  description: "A workflow with restricted access"
  permissions:
    - admin
    - john.doe@example.com
  steps:
    # workflow steps
```

## How Permissions Work

When a workflow has permissions defined:

1. **Admin users** can always run the workflow regardless of the permissions list
2. **Non-admin users** can only run the workflow if:
   - Their role is explicitly listed in the permissions
   - OR their email address is explicitly listed in the permissions
3. If the `permissions` field is empty or not defined, any user with the `write:workflows` permission can run the workflow

## Supported Role Types

Keep supports the following role types that can be used in the permissions list:

- `admin`: Administrator users with full system access
- `noc`: Network Operations Center users with read-only access
- `webhook`: API access for webhook integrations
- `workflowrunner`: Special role for running workflows via API

## Examples

### Restricting to Admin Users Only

```yaml
workflow:
  id: critical-infrastructure-workflow
  name: Critical Infrastructure Workflow
  permissions:
    - admin
  steps:
    # workflow steps
```

### Allowing Specific Users

```yaml
workflow:
  id: department-specific-workflow
  name: Department Specific Workflow
  permissions:
    - sarah.smith@example.com
    - team.lead@example.com
  steps:
    # workflow steps
```

### Combining Roles and Individual Users

```yaml
workflow:
  id: mixed-permissions-workflow
  name: Mixed Permissions Workflow
  permissions:
    - admin
    - noc
    - devops.specialist@example.com
  steps:
    # workflow steps
```

## Best Practices

- Use permissions for workflows that have significant impact on systems or trigger sensitive operations
- Consider using role-based permissions (like `admin` or `noc`) for groups of users with similar responsibilities
- List individual email addresses only for exceptions or when very specific access control is needed
- Review workflow permissions regularly as part of security audits
- Document which workflows have restricted permissions in your internal documentation
