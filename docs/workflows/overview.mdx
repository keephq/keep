## Concepts

### Triggers

Define how a workflow starts, such as manually, on a schedule, or in response to alerts with optional filters for specific conditions.

### Steps

Represent sequential operations, like querying data or running scripts, using configurable providers.

### Actions

Specify tasks performed after steps, including sending notifications, updating tickets, or invoking external services.

### Conditions

Allow decision-making in actions based on thresholds, assertions, or previous step results.

### Functions

Built-in helpers like datetime_compare or is_business_hours simplify complex operations.

### Previous Step Context

Enables access to and reuse of outputs from earlier steps within actions or conditions.

### Providers

External systems or services (e.g., Slack, Datadog, ServiceNow) integrated into workflows through a standard configuration interface.

### Variables

Use constants, dynamic variables, or contextual data to customize workflow behavior.

### Foreach Loops

Iterate over a list of results from a step to perform repeated actions for each item.

### Alert Enrichment

Add context to alerts, like customer details or ticket metadata, using enrichment mechanisms in steps or actions.
