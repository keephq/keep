<Note>Need any help with creating a Workflow? Feel free to submit an issue or join our Slack and we will help with that.</Note>
A Workflow in Keep is a YAML-based configuration file designed to manage, automate, and enrich alerts. Once uploaded to Keep, the workflow can run based on three different types of triggers: manual, alert, or interval. In this document, we'll look into each of these components in detail.

In this section we will review the Workflow components.

## Triggers
<Tip>When you run alert with the CLI using `keep run`, the CLI run the alert regardless of the triggers.</Tip>
A trigger is an event that starts the workflow. It could be a manual trigger, an alert, or an interval depending on your use case.
Keep support three types of triggers:
### Manual trigger
```
# run manually
triggers:
  - type: manual
```

### Alert trigger
```
# run every time alert from cloudwatch triggered
triggers:
  - type: alert
    filters:
      - key: source
        value: cloudwatch
```

### Interval trigger
```
# run every 10 seconds
triggers:
  - type: interval
    value: 10
```

## Steps
Steps are optional and define a sequence of actions that fetch or compute data. They are used to add data to the workflow, which can be used in other steps or actions.

## Actions
An action defines what to do when a workflow is triggered. Actions usually rely on providers for executing specific tasks, like sending a Slack message.

## Conditions
A condition sets the rules under which an action should be performed. For example, you can set a condition to only trigger an action if certain criteria are met.
