## Breakdown

### Steps

In this example we can see two steps:

- db-prod1-no-space - checks db space of db prod1
- db-prod2-no-space - checkd db space of db prod2

### Conditions

The action has two threshold conditions:

```
condition:
    - type: threshold
      value:  "{{ steps.this.results }}"
      compare_to: 90% # Trigger if more than 90% full
```

But now we've added an `alias` to each condition, so it'll be easier to check it in the `action` itself.

### Action (if statement)

The action now uses the `if` statement to alert if **one** of the databases has less than 10% disk space left.

We can use `if: "{{ A }} and {{ B }}"` to alert only if both databases has less than 10% disk space left.
_Note that its the default behavior so you may achieve the same without specifying `if` statement._
