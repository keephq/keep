This workflow demonstrates how to take actions only during specified business hours.


Explanation:
- Trigger: Activated by an alert or manually.
- Action: Check if the current time falls within business hours in the `America/New_York` timezone. If yes, enrich the alert with a `businesshours` field set to `true`.
