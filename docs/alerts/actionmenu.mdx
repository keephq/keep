### (1) Run Workflow
Trigger predefined workflows directly from the Action Menu. This allows automation of actions such as escalating alerts or notifying specific teams.

### (2) Create a New Workflow
Quickly create a new workflow tailored to the selected alert. This is useful for handling unique cases that require a custom response.

### (3) View Alert History
Access the full history of the alert, including changes to its status, comments, and any actions performed. This provides a clear timeline of the alert's lifecycle.

### (4) Manually Enrich Alert
Add custom metadata or details to an alert manually. This can include additional context or information that assists with resolution.

### (5) Self Assign
Assign the selected alert to yourself. This is ideal for team members who are taking ownership of specific alerts.

### (6) View Alert
Open the alert details in the sidebar or dedicated alert view for a deeper dive into its metadata and context.

### (7) Source-Specific Actions
Perform actions that are specific to the source of the alert. For example, linking directly to the monitoring tool or executing source-specific workflows.

### (8) Dismiss Alert
Mark the alert as dismissed to indicate that no further action is required. This helps in managing and decluttering the alert table.

### (9) Change Status
Update the status of the alert (e.g., from "firing" to "acknowledged"). This keeps the team informed about the current state of the alert.
