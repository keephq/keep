Sound notifications ensure you never miss important updates or alerts.

## How It Works
1. **Preset Notifications**: Mark a preset as "noisy," and any alert linked to it will play a sound. Alternatively, set individual alerts as `isNoisy=true` to trigger sounds through linked presets.
2. **Real-Time Alerts**: With WebSocket enabled, alerts arrive instantly. The server notifies the browser, which retrieves and processes new alerts immediately.

## Who Hears Notifications?
Users with Keep open in their browser and the noisy preset visible in their navigation bar. Presets can be filtered to control notifications.

### Customizing
1. **Change the Default Sound**: Replace the `alert.mp3` file with a custom audio file of your choice.
