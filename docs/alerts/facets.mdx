Facets in Keep provide a powerful way to analyze and filter alerts based on their attributes. This feature enables quick data exploration, trend analysis, and efficient alert filtering through an intuitive interface.

## Understanding Facets

Facets are dynamic filters that show the distribution of values across different alert attributes. They provide both filtering capabilities and statistical insights about your alerts.

## Available Facet Types

### Standard Facets
- **Severity**: Distribution of alerts by severity level
- **Status**: Breakdown of alert statuses
- **Provider**: Alert sources and their frequencies
- **Service**: Affected services distribution
- **Environment**: Distribution across environments

### Time-based Facets
- **Created Time**: Alert creation timeline
- **Updated Time**: Last modification distribution
- **Resolution Time**: Time-to-resolve statistics

### Custom Facets
- **Tags**: Distribution of custom alert tags
- **Teams**: Team assignment breakdown
- **Custom Fields**: Any additional alert attributes

## Using Facets

### Filtering
1. **Single Selection**: Click a facet value to filter
2. **Multiple Selection**: Use Ctrl/Cmd+Click for multiple values
3. **Exclusion**: Alt+Click to exclude specific values
4. **Range Selection**: For numeric and date facets

### Analysis Features
- **Value Counts**: See the number of alerts per facet value
- **Percentage View**: Toggle between count and percentage
- **Trend View**: Analyze changes over time
- **Top Values**: Quick access to most common values

## Advanced Features

### Facet Combinations
- **AND/OR Logic**: Combine multiple facets
- **Nested Facets**: Drill down through related facets
- **Dynamic Updates**: Real-time facet recalculation
- **Saved Combinations**: Store frequently used combinations

### Visualization Options
- **Bar Charts**: Visual distribution of values
- **Time Series**: Temporal analysis
- **Heat Maps**: Correlation between facets
- **Export**: Download facet data for external analysis

## Best Practices

1. **Efficient Filtering**
   - Start with broad facets
   - Progressively refine selections
   - Use multiple facets for precise filtering

2. **Analysis Workflow**
   - Monitor value distributions
   - Identify unusual patterns
   - Track trends over time

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Limit multiple selections when possible
   - Use date ranges appropriately
   - Clear unused filters
