title: "Basic Syntax"
description: "At Keep, we view alerts as workflows, which consist of a series of steps executed in sequence, each with its own specific input and output. To keep our approach simple, Keep's syntax is designed to closely resemble the syntax used in GitHub Actions. We believe that GitHub Actions has a well-established syntax, and there is no need to reinvent the wheel."

## Full Example
```yaml title=examples/raw_sql_query_datetime.yml
# Alert if a result queried from the DB is above a certain thershold.
alert:
  id: raw-sql-query
  description: Monitor that time difference is no more than 1 hour
  steps:
    - name: get-max-datetime
      provider:
        type: mysql
        config: "{{ providers.mysql-prod }}"
        with:
          # Get max(datetime) from the random table
          query: "SELECT MAX(datetime) FROM demo_table LIMIT 1"
  actions:
    - name: trigger-slack
      condition:
      - name: threshold-condition
        type: threshold
        # datetime_compare(t1, t2) compares t1-t2 and returns the diff in hours
        #   utcnow() returns the local machine datetime in UTC
        #   to_utc() converts a datetime to UTC
        value: keep.datetime_compare(keep.utcnow(), keep.to_utc("{{ steps.this.results[0][0] }}"))
        compare_to: 1 # hours
        compare_type: gt # greater than
      provider:
        type: slack
        config: " {{ providers.slack-demo }} "
        with:
          message: "DB datetime value ({{ actions.trigger-slack.conditions.threshold.0.compare_value }}) is greater than 1! 🚨"
```

## Breakdown 🔨

### Alert
```yaml
alert:
  id: raw-sql-query
  description: Monitor that time difference is no more than 1 hour
  steps:
    -
  actions:
    -
```

`Alert` is built of:
- Metadata (id, description. owners and tags will be added soon)
- `steps` - list of steps
- `actions` - list of actions
- `on-failure` - a conditionless action used in case of an alert failure

### Provider
```yaml
provider:
    type: mysql
    config: "{{ providers.mysql-prod }}"
    with:
        query: "SELECT MAX(datetime) FROM demo_table LIMIT 1"
```
`Provider` is built of:
- `type` - the type of the provider ([see supported providers](../022_providers/01-what-is-a-provider.md))
- `config` - the provider configuration. you can either supply it explicitly or using `"{{ providers.mysql-prod }}"`
- `with` - all type-specific provider configuration. for example, for `mysql` we will provide the SQL query.

### Condition
```yaml
- name: threshold-condition
  type: threshold
  value: keep.datetime_compare(keep.utcnow(), keep.to_utc("{{ steps.this.results[0][0] }}"))
  compare_to: 1
  compare_type: gt
```
`Condition` is built of:
- `name` - a unique identifier to the condition
- `type` - the type of the condition
- `value` - the value that will be supplied to the condition during the alert execution
- `compare_to` - whats `value` will be compared against
- `compare_type` - all type-specific condition configuration

### Steps/Actions
```yaml
steps/actions:
  - name: trigger-slack
    condition:
    - name: threshold-condition
      type: threshold
      value: keep.datetime_compare(keep.utcnow(), keep.to_utc("{{ steps.this.results[0][0] }}"))
      compare_to: 1
      compare_type: gt
    provider:
      type: slack
      config: " {{ providers.slack-demo }} "
      with:
        message: "DB datetime value ({{ actions.trigger-slack.conditions.threshold.0.compare_value }}) is greater than 1! 🚨"
```

`Step/Action` is built of:
- `name` - the name of the action.
- `condition` - a list of conditions that
- `provider` - the provider that will trigger the action.
- `throttle` - you can [throttle](../025_throttles/01-what-is-throttle.md) the action.
- `if` - action can be limited to when certain [conditions](../023_conditions/01-what-is-a-condition.md) are met.
- `foreach` - when `foreach` block supplied, Keep will evaluate it as a list, and evaluates the `action` for every item in the list.

The `provider` configuration is already covered in [Providers](syntax#provider)

### On-failure
```yaml
on-failure:
    # Just need a provider we can use to send the failure reason
    provider:
      type: slack
      config: " {{ providers.slack-demo }} "
```

On-failure is actually a condtionless `Action` used to notify in case the alert failed with an exception.
The provider is passed a `message` (string) to it's `notify` function.
