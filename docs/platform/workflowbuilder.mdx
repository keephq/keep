You'll need to provide:
1. Provider name.
2. Provider authentication details.
Each provider has its own authentication process. To learn about a specific Provider authentication, you can go to the Provider page.


## Webhook Integration
The webhook integration let you seamlessly push your alerts to Keep.
It means that when you connect the Provider, Keep hooks the Provider configuration to add itself as a destination. For example, when you connect AWS CloudWatch, Keep subscribes itself to all Alarm's topics, so every alarm goes through Keep.

A webhook integration available if it has "Webhook available" icon:
