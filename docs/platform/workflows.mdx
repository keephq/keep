The Workflows page implements a convinent interface to manage your workflows.

Workflows can be triggered by:

1. Alert

3. Manually

You can learn more about how to [create workflows](/workflows/getting-started) and about the [workflows syntax](/workflows/syntax) in the workflows docs or in the [examples](https://github.com/keephq/keep/tree/main/examples/workflows) section in Keep repository.
