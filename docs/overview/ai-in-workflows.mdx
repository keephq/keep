AI in workflows enables you to integrate third-party AI providers as "steps" and "actions" within your workflows. 

Could be useful for:
1. Human input normalization.
2. Routing.
3. Severity definition.
4. Summorization.

Supported providers include DeepSeek, OpenAI, Anthropic, Grok, Gemini, Ollama, Llama.cpp, vLLM, and more. Check the "AI" filter on the "Providers" page for a complete list.

## Frequent questions:

**Model used:** client's own 3'rd party LLM provider. Could be cloud or self-hosted.<br/>
**Privacy:** Data stays within Keep unless it's explicitly processed wia workflow to an explicitly connected 3'rd party provider. Data flow is defined by user.
