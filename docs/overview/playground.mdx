- [Incidents](#incidents)
- [Providers](#providers)
- [Workflows](#workflows)
- [AIOps Techniques](#aiops-techniques)


## Alerts

Get a single pane of glass view for all your alerts with customizable presets. Use CEL (Common Expression Language) syntax for precise filtering, configure the alerts table layout to match your workflow, and explore facets for quick insights into alert patterns and metrics.

## Incidents

Examine incidents in detail, including their associated alerts and timelines. Test correlation logic and mapping configurations that group related alerts into incidents, and validate your suppression or resolution strategies.

## Providers

Integrate with external data sources or alert providers like Prometheus, Datadog, or GCP Monitoring. Configure and test mappings to ensure proper ingestion and normalization of data from various sources into Keep's unified schema.

## Workflows

Build and test automated workflows to manage alerts and incidents with precision. Experiment with both an intuitive UI builder and advanced scripting capabilities to trigger actions, notifications, or external integrations based on dynamic conditions.

## AIOps Techniques

Test and refine deduplication, enrichment, mapping, and extraction rules to optimize alert handling. Experiment with these techniques to transform raw alerts into actionable data and reduce noise effectively.
