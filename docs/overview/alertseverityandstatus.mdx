title: "Alerts Severity and Status"
---

In Keep, alerts are treated as first-class citizens, with clearly defined severities and statuses to aid in quick and efficient response.

## Alert Severity
Alert severity in Keep is classified into five categories, helping teams prioritize their response based on the urgency and impact of the alert.

| Severity Level | Description                                           |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| CRITICAL       | Requires immediate action.                            |
| HIGH           | Needs to be addressed soon.                           |
| WARNING        | Indicates a potential problem.                        |
| INFO           | Provides information, no immediate action required.   |
| LOW            | Minor issues or lowest priority.

## Alert Status
The status of an alert in Keep reflects its current state in the alert lifecycle.

| Status       | Description                                                                 |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| FIRING       | Active alert indicating an ongoing issue.                                   |
| RESOLVED     | The issue has been resolved, and the alert is no longer active.             |
| ACKNOWLEDGED | The alert has been acknowledged but not resolved.                           |
| TRIGGERED    | Alert condition is met, but not yet firing.                                 |
| SUPPRESSED   | Alert is suppressed due to various reasons.                                 |
| PENDING      | No Data or insufficient data to determine the alert state.                  |


## Provider Alert Mappings
Different providers might have their specific ways of defining and handling alert severity and status.
Keep standardizes these variations by mapping them to the defined enums (AlertSeverity and AlertStatus).

Here's how various providers align with Keep's alert system:

| Provider      | Severity Mapping                                                               | Status Mapping                                                                                                  |
