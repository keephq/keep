The Keep Rule Engine is a versatile tool for grouping and consolidating alerts into incidents or incident-candidates.
This guide explains the core concepts, usage, and best practices for effectively utilizing the rule engine.

<Note>Access the Rule Engine UI through the Keep platform by navigating to the Rule Builder section.</Note>

## Core Concepts
- **Rule definition**: A rule in Keep is a set of conditions that, when met, creates an incident or incident-candidate.
- **Alert attributes**: These are characteristics or data points of an alert, such as source, severity, or any attribute an alert might have.
- **Conditions and logic**: Rules are built by defining conditions based on alert attributes, using logical operators (like AND/OR) to combine multiple conditions.

## Creating Rules
Creating a rule involves defining the conditions under which an alert should be categorized or actions should be grouped.

1. **Accessing the Rule Engine**: Navigate to the Rule Engine section in the Keep platform.
2. **Defining rule criteria**:
 - **Name the rule**: Assign a descriptive name that reflects its purpose.
 - **Set conditions**: Use alert attributes to create conditions. For example, a rule might specify that an alert with a severity of 'critical' and a source of 'Prometheus' should be categorized as 'High Priority'.
 - **Logical grouping**: Combine conditions using logical operators to form comprehensive rules.
 - **Manual approve**: Create Incident-candidate or full-fledged incident.

## Examples
- **Metric-based alerts**: Construct a rule to pinpoint alerts associated with specific metrics, such as high CPU usage on servers. This can be achieved by grouping alerts that share a common attribute, like a 'CPU usage' tag, ensuring you quickly identify and address performance issues.
- **Feature-related alerts**: Establish rules to create incident by specific features or services. For instance, you can start incident based on a 'service' or 'URL' tag. This approach is particularly useful for tracking and managing alerts related to distinct functionalities or components within your application.
- **Team-based alert management**: Implement rules to create incidents according to team responsibilities. This might involve grouping based on the systems or services a particular team oversees. Such a strategy ensures that alerts are promptly directed to the appropriate team, enhancing response times and efficiency.
