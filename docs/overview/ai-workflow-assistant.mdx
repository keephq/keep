AI-driven workflow builder (don't confuse it with [AI in workflows](./ai-in-workflows)) is a chat-like UI to build workflows using natural language. 
It works in the “human in the loop” paradigm, proposing changes and applying them only after the user's explicit consent. 
It simplifies workflow-building routines and helps a broader group of engineers within the organization adopt workflows.


Go to "Workflows" -> "+ Create Workflow" to find the AI Assistant:
