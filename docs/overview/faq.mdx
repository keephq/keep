## FAQ

### 1. "Failed to copy alert/fingerprint. Please check your browser permissions"

Modern browsers block clipboard access from insecure ("http") origins for security reasons. To resolve this:

- For production: Configure HTTPS for your Keep deployment
- For local development: Use "localhost" which browsers treat as a secure origin
- If using a custom domain locally: Enable HTTPS or switch to "localhost"
