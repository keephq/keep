The Semi-Automatic Incident Engine is a powerful tool designed for teams handling a moderate volume of alerts (fewer than 100 per day). It helps you quickly identify critical issues among numerous alerts—finding the needle in the haystack.

How to use:

1. Navigate to the Feed section
2. Select a few alerts
3. Click the "Create Incidents With AI" button

Once activated, the system will process your alerts through its LLM (Large Language Model) and present you with potential incident candidates for review.

## Frequent questions:

**Model used:** OpenAI, a model hosted by Keep, or other.<br/>
