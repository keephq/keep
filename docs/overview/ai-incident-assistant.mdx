The AI incident assistant is a chat feature embedded in the incident page. It streamlines all incident context—including 
alerts, descriptions, and impacted topology—to the LLM, helping on-call engineers gather information faster and 
resolve incidents more efficiently. Users can ask for root cause analysis and even execute commands on third-party 
services ([read more about provider methods](/providers/provider-methods#via-ai-assistant)).
