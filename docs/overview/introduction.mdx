## What's AIOps?

In simple words, AI for IT Operations (aka AIOps) is about automating repetitive tasks, reducing noise from monitoring tools, and helping teams overcome alert fatigue by turning overwhelming data into actionable insights.

With AIOps, teams can eliminate noise, prioritize critical issues, and focus on solving real problems rather than constantly firefighting alerts.

## Why do we build Keep?

Working with current tools such as BigPanda, Splunk ITSI, or ServiceNow ITOM, we identified a gap:

- **No Open Source Solution:** We have Grafana for visualization and Prometheus for metrics, but nothing for AIOps. Keep fills this gap as the first open-source solution for AIOps.
- **Not DevOps/SRE Friendly:** Current tools are enterprise-focused but not in a good way. If you're an SRE team lead or head of IT operations in a company with ~100 employees, the existing tools won't work for you. They're too expensive, and their UX requires a dedicated team just for setup and maintenance. Keep is enterprise-ready (scaling, SSO, etc.) but also designed for small teams that want to adopt AIOps practices.
- **A "Post LLM Era" AIOps:** Existing tools were built in a different technical era. Keep is designed to leverage the advancements of the large language model (LLM) era, integrating AI more seamlessly into IT operations.

## Our Philosophy

- **Easy to start** – Whether locally or on Kubernetes, we provide one-click solutions like `helm install` and `docker-compose` so you can quickly spin up Keep and start exploring its capabilities.
- **Easy to extend** – Keep is designed with extensibility in mind, making it straightforward to add new integrations or functionality to meet your specific needs.
- **Easy to deploy** – Every aspect of Keep can be provisioned as code, enabling seamless automation of deployments and integration into your CI/CD pipelines.
- **Easy to collaborate** – As an open-source project, we truly believe in the power of community and collaboration. We actively listen to user feedback and strive to continuously improve Keep based on the needs and insights of our users.

## Our Vision

Keep is built so every team can benefit from AIOps.

Whether you're a small team looking for a Kubernetes-local single pane of glass for your Prometheus alerts, or an enterprise with dozens of tools generating alerts and needing to sync with your ServiceNow tickets, Keep is for you.

Our vision is to democratize AIOps, making it accessible and practical for teams of all sizes.
