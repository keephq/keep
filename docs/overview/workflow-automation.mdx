---

Workflow automation is a core capability in Keep, designed to transform how you manage alerts and incidents. It allows you to automate responses, integrate seamlessly with your existing tools, and build complex workflows tailored to your needs. With workflow automation, you can reduce manual effort, improve response times, and ensure consistent handling of recurring scenarios.

This section provides an abstract overview of workflows in Keep. To dive deeper into creating and managing workflows, refer to the dedicated [Workflow Documentation](#workflow-documentation) and explore our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/keephq/keep-workflows) for ready-to-use examples.

## Why Workflow Automation is Core

Workflow automation is not just an add-on in Keep—it's integral to the platform's design. Every alert, incident, or integration can be part of a workflow. Whether it’s auto-creating tickets, sending Slack notifications, or enriching alerts with external data, workflows are central to making Keep a powerful and flexible tool for your IT operations.
