## By Use Case

### Central Alert Management
No more navigating between multiple Prometheus instances and dealing with per-region, per-account CloudWatch settings. By linking your alert-triggering tools to Keep, you gain a centralized dashboard for managing all your alerts. Review, throttle, mute, and fine-tune alerts from a single console.

### Alerts Enrichment
Keep allows you to enrich alerts with additional context from observability tools, databases, and ticketing systems. Need enterprise-specific alert triggers or want to include extra details about customer impact? Keep makes it easy to augment alerts for better decision-making.

### Automate Alert Response
Automate responses to common alerts, reducing the time spent on repetitive tasks. For example, confirm a 502 error on an endpoint with an additional query or check if an issue affects a low-priority customer before escalating it to your team.

### Multi-Environment Monitoring
Centralize alerts across multiple environments, such as staging, production, and testing. Keep helps you manage environment-specific rules while providing a unified view of your system health.

### Noise Reduction
Use deduplication, throttling, and muting to significantly reduce noise from excessive or redundant alerts. Keep ensures your teams are only notified of critical issues.

### SLA Compliance
Track alert resolution times and ensure compliance with SLAs. Keep’s automation and reporting features enable you to monitor and meet contractual obligations seamlessly.

### Incident Correlation
Correlate related alerts to identify the root cause of incidents quickly. Use Keep’s workflows and mapping rules to group alerts and provide actionable insights for resolution.

### Ticketing Integration
Sync alerts with ticketing tools like Jira and ServiceNow. Automate ticket creation, track updates, and ensure seamless workflows between operations and development teams.
