title: "Comparison"
---

It's often easier to grasp a tool's features by comparing it to others in the same ecosystem. Here, we'll explain how Keep interacts with and compares to these tools.

## Keep vs IRM (PagerDuty, OpsGenie, etc.)

Incident management tools aim to notify the right person at the right time, simplify reporting, and set up efficient war rooms.

"Keep" focuses on the alert lifecycle, noise reduction, and AI-driven alert-incident correlation. Essentially, Keep acts as an 'intelligent layer before the IRM,' managing millions of alerts before they reach your IRM tool. Keep offers high-quality integrations with PagerDuty, OpsGenie, Grafana OnCall, and more.

## Keep vs AIOps in Observability (Elastic, Splunk, etc.)

Keep is different because it’s able to correlate alerts between different observability platforms.

## Keep vs AIOps platforms (BigPanda, Moogsoft, etc.)

Keep is an alternative to platforms like BigPanda and Moogsoft. 
Customers who have used both traditional platforms and Keep notice a significant improvement in alert correlation. Unlike the manual methods of other platforms, Keep uses advanced state-of-the-art AI models for easier and more effective alert correlation.
