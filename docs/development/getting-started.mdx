## Docker-compose

### Spin up Keep with docker-compose latest images
The easiest way to start keep is is with docker-compose:
```
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keephq/keep/main/docker-compose.yml | docker-compose -f - up
```

The docker-compose.yml contains two services:
- keep-backend - a fastapi service that as the API server.
- keep-frontend - a nextjs app that serves as Keep UI interface.

### Docker-compose dev images
You can use `docker-compose.dev.yaml` to start Keep in a development mode.

First, clone the Keep repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/keephq/keep.git && cd keep
```

Next, run
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml - up
```


## Kubernetes
Keep can be installed via Helm Chart.

First, clone Keep:
```
git clone https://github.com/keephq/keep.git && cd keep
```

Next, install using:
```
helm install -f chart/keep/values.yaml keep chart/keep/
```

Notice for it to work locally, you'll need this port forwarding:
```
kubectl port-forward svc/keep-frontend 3000:3000
```

To learn more about Keep's helm chart, see https://github.com/keephq/keep/blob/main/chart/keep/README.md

## VSCode
You can run Keep from your VSCode (after cloning the repo) by adding this configurations to your `launch.json`:

```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
      {
        "name": "Keep Backend",
        "type": "python",
        "request": "launch",
        "program": "keep/cli/cli.py",
        "console": "integratedTerminal",
        "justMyCode": false,
        "args": ["--json", "api","--multi-tenant"],
        "env": {"PYDEVD_DISABLE_FILE_VALIDATION": "1"}
      },
      {
        "name": "Keep Frontend",
        "type": "node-terminal",
        "request": "launch",
        "command": "npm run dev",
        "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}/keep-ui",
      }
    ]
  }
```

## VSCode + Docker
<Info>For this guide to work, the VSCode Docker extension is required.</Info>
<Tip>In air-gapped environments, you might consider building the container on an internet-connected computer, exporting the image using docker save, transferring it with docker load in the air-gapped environment, and then using the run configuration.</Tip>

In cases where you want to develop Keep but are unable to run it directly on your local laptop (e.g., with Windows), or if you lack access to all of its dependencies (e.g., in air-gapped environments), you can still accomplish this using VSCode and Docker.

To achieve this, follow these steps:

1. Clone Keep and open it with VSCode
2. Create a tasks.json file to build and run the Keep API and Keep UI containers.
3. Create a launch.json configuration to start the containers and attach a debugger to them.
4. Profit.


### Clone Keep and open it with VSCode
```
git clone https://github.com/keephq/keep.git && cd keep
code .
```

### Create tasks.json

#### without building the containers
<Tip>To start Keep without building the containers, you'll need to have `keep-api-dev` and `keep-ui-dev` images loaded into your docker.</Tip>
