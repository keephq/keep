## Run Locally

### Docker-compose (Option 1)

Run _Keep_ full stack (Console & API)

```bash
docker-compose up
```
Or

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```
If you want to run *Keep* in [development mode](https://development-mode-url) (code compiles on changes)

<Note>
    **OpenAPI Integration**

    Please note that some features used by Keep requires OpenAI API key to work. Export `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-YOUR_API_KEY` before running docker-compose to make them available.

    For example:

    ```bash
    OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-YOUR_API_KEY docker-compose up
    ```
</Note>

### Clone and install (Option 2)
Try our first mock alert and get it up and running in

**First, clone Keep repository:**

```shell
git clone https://github.com/keephq/keep.git && cd keep
```

**Install Keep CLI**

```shell
pip install .
```
or

```shell
poetry install
```

**From now on, Keep should be installed locally and accessible from your CLI, test it by executing:**

```
keep version
```

**Get a Slack Incoming Webhook using [this tutorial](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks) and use use Keep to configure it**

```
keep config provider --provider-type slack --provider-id slack-demo
```
Paste the Slack Incoming Webhook URL (e.g. https://hooks.slack.com/services/...) and you're good to go 👌

**Let's now execute our example "Paper DB has insufficient disk space" alert**

```bash
keep run --alerts-file examples/alerts/db_disk_space.yml
```

**Congrats 🥳 You should have received your first "Dunder Mifflin Paper Company" alert in Slack by now.**

## Enable Auto Completion

**Keep's CLI supports shell auto-completion, which can make your life a whole lot easier 😌**

If you're using zsh

```shell title=~/.zshrc
eval "$(_KEEP_COMPLETE=zsh_source keep)"
```

If you're using bash

```bash title=~/.bashrc
eval "$(_KEEP_COMPLETE=bash_source keep)"
```

> Using eval means that the command is invoked and evaluated every time a shell is started, which can delay shell responsiveness. To speed it up, write the generated script to a file, then source that.
