## Topology
This provider pulls [topology](/overview/servicetopology) to Keep. It could be used in [correlations](/overview/correlation-topology) 
and [mapping](/overview/enrichment/mapping#mapping-with-topology-data), and as a context 
for [alerts](/alerts/sidebar#7-alert-topology-view) and [incidents](/overview#17-incident-topology).
