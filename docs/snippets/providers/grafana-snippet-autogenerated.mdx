## Topology
This provider pulls [topology](/overview/servicetopology) to Keep. It could be used in [correlations](/overview/correlation-topology) 
and [mapping](/overview/enrichment/mapping#mapping-with-topology-data), and as a context 
for [alerts](/alerts/sidebar#7-alert-topology-view) and [incidents](/overview#17-incident-topology).
## Connecting via Webhook (omnidirectional)
This provider supports webhooks.

If your Grafana is unreachable from Keep, you can use the following webhook url to configure Grafana to send alerts to Keep:
    
    1. In Grafana, go to the Alerting tab in the Grafana dashboard.
    2. Click on Contact points in the left sidebar and create a new one.
    3. Give it a name and select Webhook as kind of contact point with webhook url as KEEP_BACKEND_URL/alerts/event/grafana.
    4. Add 'X-API-KEY' as the request header {api_key}.
    5. Save the webhook.
    6. Click on Notification policies in the left sidebar
    7. Click on "New child policy" under the "Default policy"
    8. Remove all matchers until you see the following: "If no matchers are specified, this notification policy will handle all alert instances."
    9. Chose the webhook contact point you have just created under Contact point and click "Save Policy"
