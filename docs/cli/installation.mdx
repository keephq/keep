<Info>Missing an installation? submit a <a href="https://github.com/keephq/keep/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=use_case.md&title=">new installation</a>  request and we will add it as soon as we can.</Info>

<Info>
The installation is possible only with Python version 3.11
</Info>
## Clone and install (Option 1)

### Install
First, clone Keep repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/keephq/keep.git && cd keep
```

Install Keep CLI with `pip`:

```shell
pip install .
```
or with `poetry`:

```shell
poetry install
```

From now on, Keep should be installed locally and accessible from your CLI, test it by executing:

```
keep version
```

### Test
Get a Slack Incoming Webhook using [this tutorial](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks) and use use Keep to configure it

```
keep config provider --provider-type slack --provider-id slack-demo
```
Paste the Slack Incoming Webhook URL (e.g. https://hooks.slack.com/services/...) and you're good to go 👌

Let's now execute our example "Paper DB has insufficient disk space" alert

```bash
keep run --alerts-file examples/workflows/db_disk_space.yml
```

Congrats 🥳 You should have received your first "Dunder Mifflin Paper Company" alert in Slack by now.


## Docker image (Option 2)
### Install

```
docker run -v ${PWD}:/app -it us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/keephq/keep/keep-cli config provider --provider-type slack --provider-id slack-demo
```

### Test
```
docker run -v ${PWD}:/app -it us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/keephq/keep/keep-cli -j run --alert-url https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keephq/keep/main/examples/alerts/db_disk_space.yml
```


## Enable Auto Completion
Keep's CLI supports shell auto-completion, which can make your life a whole lot easier 😌
If you're using zsh

```shell title=~/.zshrc
eval "$(_KEEP_COMPLETE=zsh_source keep)"
```

If you're using bash

```bash title=~/.bashrc
eval "$(_KEEP_COMPLETE=bash_source keep)"
```

<Info>Using eval means that the command is invoked and evaluated every time a shell is started, which can delay shell responsiveness. To speed it up, write the generated script to a file, then source that.</Info>
