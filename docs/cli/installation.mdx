<Info>
We recommend to install Keep CLI with Python version 3.11 for optimal compatibility and performance.
This choice ensures seamless integration with all dependencies, including pyarrow, which currently does not support Python 3.12
</Info>

<Tip>Need Keep CLI on other versions? Feel free to contact us! </Tip>

## Clone and install (Option 1)

### Install
First, clone Keep repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/keephq/keep.git && cd keep
```

Install Keep CLI with `pip`:

```shell
# MacOS if python or pip not present:
# brew install python@3.11
# brew install postgresql
pip3.11 install .
```
or with `poetry`:

```shell
poetry install
```

From now on, Keep should be installed locally and accessible from your CLI, test it by executing:

```
keep version
```

### Configuration

To get API key, check Keep UI -> your username (bottom left) -> Settings -> API Keys
```
keep config new --url http://backend.my_keep.my_awesome_org.com:backend_port --api-key your_personal_api_key
```

### Test

Now, 
```
keep workflow apply -f examples/workflows/query_clickhouse.yml
```

Congrats ðŸ¥³ Check your UI for the new workflow uploaded from the YAML file.


## Docker image (Option 2)
### Install

```
docker run -v ${PWD}:/app -v ~/.keep.yaml:/root/.keep.yaml -it us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/keephq/keep/keep-cli keep config new --url http://backend.my_keep.my_awesome_org.com:backend_port --api-key your_personal_api_key
```

### Test
```
docker run -v ${PWD}:/app -v ~/.keep.yaml:/root/.keep.yaml -it us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/keephq/keep/keep-cli workflow apply -f examples/workflows/query_clickhouse.yml
```


## Enable Auto Completion
Keep's CLI supports shell auto-completion, which can make your life a whole lot easier ðŸ˜Œ
If you're using zsh

```shell title=~/.zshrc
eval "$(_KEEP_COMPLETE=zsh_source keep)"
```

If you're using bash

```bash title=~/.bashrc
eval "$(_KEEP_COMPLETE=bash_source keep)"
```

<Info>Using eval means that the command is invoked and evaluated every time a shell is started, which can delay shell responsiveness. To speed it up, write the generated script to a file, then source that.</Info>
