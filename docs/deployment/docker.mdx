### Spin up Keep with docker-compose latest images
The easiest way to start keep is is with docker-compose:
```shell
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keephq/keep/main/start.sh | sh
```

```bash start.sh
#!/bin/bash
# Keep install script for docker compose

echo "Creating state directory."
mkdir -p state
test -e state
echo "Changing directory ownership to non-privileged user."
chown -R 999:999 state || echo "Unable to change directory ownership, changing permissions instead." && chmod -R 0777 state
which curl &> /dev/null || echo "curl not installed"
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keephq/keep/main/docker-compose.yml --output docker-compose.yml
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keephq/keep/main/docker-compose.common.yml --output docker-compose.common.yml

docker compose up -d
```

The docker-compose.yml contains 3 services:
- [keep-backend](https://console.cloud.google.com/artifacts/docker/keephq/us-central1/keep/keep-api?project=keephq) - a fastapi service that as the API server.
- [keep-frontend](https://console.cloud.google.com/artifacts/docker/keephq/us-central1/keep/keep-ui?project=keephq) - a nextjs app that serves as Keep UI interface.
- [keep-websocket-server](https://docs.soketi.app/getting-started/installation/docker) - Soketi (a pusher compatible websocket server) for real time alerting.

### Reinstall Keep with the option to refresh from scratch

`Caution:` This usage context will refresh from the beginning and Keep's data and settings will be erased. Even other containers on this host are also erased. So please consider when using the steps below.
