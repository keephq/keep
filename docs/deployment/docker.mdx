### Spin up Keep with docker-compose latest images
The easiest way to start keep is is with docker-compose:
```shell
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keephq/keep/main/start.sh | sh
```

```bash start.sh
#!/bin/bash
# Keep install script for docker compose

echo "Creating state directory."
mkdir -p state
test -e state
echo "Changing directory ownership to non-privileged user."
chown -R 999:999 state || echo "Unable to change directory ownership, changing permissions instead." && chmod -R 0777 state
which curl &> /dev/null || echo "curl not installed"
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keephq/keep/main/docker-compose.yml --output docker-compose.yml
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keephq/keep/main/docker-compose.common.yml --output docker-compose.common.yml

docker compose up -d
```

The docker-compose.yml contains 3 services:
- [keep-backend](https://console.cloud.google.com/artifacts/docker/keephq/us-central1/keep/keep-api?project=keephq) - a fastapi service that as the API server.
- [keep-frontend](https://console.cloud.google.com/artifacts/docker/keephq/us-central1/keep/keep-ui?project=keephq) - a nextjs app that serves as Keep UI interface.
- [keep-websocket-server](https://docs.soketi.app/getting-started/installation/docker) - Soketi (a pusher compatible websocket server) for real time alerting.
