## Overview

<Tip>Secret Manager selection is crucial for securing your application. Different modes can be set up depending on the deployment type. Our system supports four primary secret manager types.</Tip>

## Secret Manager Factory

The `SecretManagerFactory` is a utility class used to create instances of different types of secret managers. It leverages the Factory design pattern to abstract the creation logic based on the type of secret manager required. The factory supports creating instances of File, GCP, Kubernetes, and Vault Secret Managers.

The `SECRET_MANAGER_TYPE` environment variable plays a crucial role in the SecretManagerFactory for determining the default type of secret manager to be instantiated when no specific type is provided in the method call.

**Functionality**:

**Default Secret Manager**: If the `SECRET_MANAGER_TYPE` environment variable is set, its value dictates the default type of secret manager that the factory will create.
The value of this variable should correspond to one of the types defined in SecretManagerTypes enum (`FILE`, `GCP`, `K8S`, `VAULT`).

**Example Configuration**:

Setting `SECRET_MANAGER_TYPE=GCP` in the environment will make the factory create instances of GcpSecretManager by default.
If `SECRET_MANAGER_TYPE` is not set or is set to `FILE`, the factory defaults to creating instances of FileSecretManager.
This environment variable provides flexibility and ease of configuration, allowing different secret managers to be used in different environments or scenarios without code changes.

## File Secert Manager

The `FileSecretManager` is a concrete implementation of the BaseSecretManager for managing secrets stored in the file system. It uses a specified directory (defaulting to ./) to read, write, and delete secret files.

Configuration:

Set the environment variable `SECRET_MANAGER_DIRECTORY` to specify the directory where secrets are stored. If not set, defaults to the current directory (./).

Usage:

- Secrets are stored as files in the specified directory.
- Reading a secret involves fetching content from a file.
- Writing a secret creates or updates a file with the given content.
- Deleting a secret removes the corresponding file.

## Kubernetes Secret Manager

The `KubernetesSecretManager` interfaces with Kubernetes' native secrets system. It manages secrets within a specified Kubernetes namespace and is designed to operate within a Kubernetes cluster.

Configuration:

Set `K8S_NAMESPACE` environment variable to specify the Kubernetes namespace. Defaults to default if not set. Assumes Kubernetes configurations (like service account tokens) are properly set up when running within a cluster.

Usage:

- Secrets are stored as Kubernetes Secret objects.
- Provides functionalities to create, retrieve, and delete Kubernetes secrets.
- Handles base64 encoding and decoding as required by Kubernetes.

## GCP Secret Manager

The `GcpSecretManager` utilizes Google Cloud's Secret Manager service for secret management. It requires setting up with Google Cloud credentials and a project ID.

Configuration:

Ensure the environment variable `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` is set with your Google Cloud project ID.

Usage:

- Secrets are managed using Google Cloud's Secret Manager.
- Supports operations to create, access, and delete secrets in the cloud.
- Integrates with OpenTelemetry for tracing secret management operations.

## Hashicorp Vault Secret Manager

The `VaultSecretManager` is tailored for Hashicorp Vault, a tool for managing sensitive data. It supports token-based authentication as well as Kubernetes-based authentication for Vault.

Configuration:

- Set `HASHICORP_VAULT_ADDR` to the Vault server address. Defaults to http://localhost:8200.
- Use `HASHICORP_VAULT_TOKEN` for token-based authentication.
- Set `HASHICORP_VAULT_USE_K8S` to True and provide `HASHICORP_VAULT_K8S_ROLE` for Kubernetes-based authentication.

Usage:

- Manages secrets in a Hashicorp Vault server.
- Provides methods to write, read, and delete secrets from Vault.
- Supports different Vault authentication methods including static tokens and Kubernetes service account tokens.
