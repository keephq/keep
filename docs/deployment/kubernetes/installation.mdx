<Tip>
The recommended way to install Keep on Kubernetes is via Helm Chart. <br></br>
Follow these steps to set it up.
</Tip>

## Prerequisites

### Helm CLI
See the [Helm documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) for instructions about installing helm.

### Ingress Controller (Optional)
<Info>
You can skip this step if:
1. You already have **ingress-nginx** installed.
2. You don't need to expose Keep to the internet/network.
</Info>

#### Overview
An ingress controller is essential for managing external access to services in your Kubernetes cluster. It acts as a smart router and load balancer, allowing you to expose multiple services through a single entry point while handling SSL termination and routing rules.
**Keep works the best with** [ingress-nginx](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx) **but you can customize the helm chart for other ingress controllers too.**


#### Check ingress-nginx Installed
You check if you already have ingress-nginx installed:
```bash
# By default, the ingress-nginx will be installed under the ingress-nginx namespace
kubectl -n ingress-nginx get pods
NAME                                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
ingress-nginx-controller-d49697d5f-hjhbj   1/1     Running   0          4h19m

# Or check for the ingress class
kubectl get ingressclass
NAME    CONTROLLER             PARAMETERS   AGE
nginx   k8s.io/ingress-nginx   <none>       4h19m

```

#### Install ingress-nginx
<Info>
To read about more installation options, see [ingress-nginx installation docs](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/).
</Info>
```bash
# simplest way to install
helm upgrade --install ingress-nginx ingress-nginx \
  --repo https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx \
  --namespace ingress-nginx --create-namespace
```

Verify installation:
```bash
kubectl get ingressclass
NAME    CONTROLLER             PARAMETERS   AGE
nginx   k8s.io/ingress-nginx   <none>       4h19m
```

Verify if snippet annotations are enabled:
```bash
kubectl get configmap -n ingress-nginx ingress-nginx-controller -o yaml | grep allow-snippet-annotations
allow-snippet-annotations: "true"
```

## Installation

### With Ingress-NGINX (Recommended)

```bash
# Add the Helm repository
helm repo add keephq https://keephq.github.io/helm-charts

# Install Keep with ingress enabled
helm install keep keephq/keep -n keep --create-namespace
```

### Without Ingress-NGINX (Not Recommended)

```bash
# Add the Helm repository
helm repo add keephq https://keephq.github.io/helm-charts

# Install Keep without ingress enabled.
# You won't be able to access Keep from the network.
helm install keep keephq/keep -n keep --create-namespace \
  --set global.ingress.enabled=false
```

## Accessing Keep

### Ingress
If you installed Keep with ingress, you should be able to access Keep.

```bash
kubectl -n keep get ingress
NAME           CLASS   HOSTS   ADDRESS        PORTS   AGE
keep-ingress   nginx   *       X.X.X.X        80      4h16m
```

Keep is available at http://X.X.X.X :)

### Without Ingress (Port-Forwarding)

Use the following commands to access Keep locally without ingress:
```bash
# Forward the UI
kubectl port-forward svc/keep-frontend 3000:3000 -n keep &

# Forward the Backend
kubectl port-forward svc/keep-backend 8080:8080 -n keep &

# Forward WebSocket server (optional)
kubectl port-forward svc/keep-websocket 6001:6001 -n keep &
```

Keep is available at http://localhost:3000 :)

## Configuring HTTPS

### Prerequisites
1. Domain Name: Example - keep.yourcompany.com
2. TLS Certificate: Private key (tls.key) and certificate (tls.crt)

### Create the TLS Secret

Assuming:
- `tls.crt` contains the certificate.
- `tls.key` contains the private key.

```bash
# create the secret with kubectl
kubectl create secret tls keep-tls --cert=./tls.crt --key=./tls.key -n keep
```

### Update Helm Values for TLS
```bash
helm upgrade -n keep keep keephq/keep \
  --set "global.ingress.hosts[0]=keep.example.com" \
  --set "global.ingress.tls[0].hosts[0]=keep.example.com" \
  --set "global.ingress.tls[0].secretName=keep-tls"
```



Alternatively, update your `values.yaml`:
```bash
...
global:
  ingress:
    hosts:
      - host: keep.example.com
    tls:
      - hosts:
          - keep.example.com
        secretName: keep-tls
...
```


## Uninstallation
To remove Keep and clean up:
```bash
helm uninstall keep -n keep
kubectl delete namespace keep
```
