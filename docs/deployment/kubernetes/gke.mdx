## Step 0: Prerequisites

1. GKE cluster (**required**)
2. kubectl and helm installed (**required**)
3. Domain + Certificate (**optional**, for TLS)



## Step 1: Configure Keep's helm repo
```bash
# configure the helm repo
helm repo add keephq https://keephq.github.io/helm-charts
helm pull keephq/keep


# make sure you are going to install Keep
helm search repo keep
NAME       	CHART VERSION	APP VERSION	DESCRIPTION
keephq/keep	0.1.20       	0.25.4     	Keep Helm Chart
```

## Step 2: Install Keep

<Tip>Do not install Keep in your default namespace. Its best practice to create a dedicated namespace.</Tip>

Let's create a dedicated namespace and install Keep in it:
```bash
# create a dedicated namespace for Keep
kubectl create ns keep

# Install keep
helm install -n keep keep keephq/keep --set isGKE=true --set namespace=keep

# You should see something like:
NAME: keep
LAST DEPLOYED: Thu Oct 10 11:31:07 2024
NAMESPACE: keep
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
```

<Tip>
As number of cofiguration change from the vanilla helm chart increase, it may be more convient to create a `values.yaml` and use it:


```bash
cat values.yaml
isGke=true
namespace=keep

helm install -n keep keep keephq/keep -f values.yaml
```

</Tip>

Now, let's make sure everything installed correctly:

```bash
# Note: it can take few minutes until GKE assign the public IP's to the ingresses
helm-charts % kubectl -n keep get ingress,svc,pod,backendconfig
NAME                                      CLASS    HOSTS                         ADDRESS         PORTS   AGE

backendconfig.cloud.google.com/keep-backend-backendconfig    5m28s
backendconfig.cloud.google.com/keep-frontend-backendconfig   5m28s
```

You can access Keep by browsing the frontend IP:
```
frontend_ip=$(kubectl -n keep get ingress | grep frontend | awk '{ print $4 }')
```

<Tip>Keep is now running with its vanilla configuration. This tutorial focus on how to spin up Keep on GKE using Keep's helm chart and doesn't cover all Keep's environment variables and configuration.</Tip>

## Step 3: Configure domain and certificate (TLS)

### Background

Keep has three ingresses that allow external access to its various components:

<Tip>
In this tutorial we focus om exposing the frontend, but exposing the backend and the websocket server is basically the same.
</Tip>

#### Frontend Ingress (Required)
This ingress serves the main UI of Keep. It is required for users to access the dashboard and interact with the platform. The frontend is exposed on port 80 by default (or 443 when TLS is configured) and typically points to the public-facing interface of your Keep installation.

#### Backend Ingress (Optional, enabled by default in `values.yaml`)
This ingress provides access to the backend API, which powers all the business logic, integrations, and alerting services of Keep. The backend ingress is usually accessed by frontend components or other services through internal or external API calls. By default, this ingress is enabled in the Helm chart and exposed internally unless explicitly configured with external domain access.

#### Websocket Ingress (Optional, disabled by default in `values.yaml`)
This ingress supports real-time communication and push updates for the frontend without requiring page reloads. It is essential for use cases where live alert updates or continuous status changes need to be reflected immediately on the dashboard. Since not every deployment requires real-time updates, the WebSocket ingress is disabled by default but can be enabled as needed by updating the Helm chart configuration.



### Prerequisites

#### Domain
e.g. keep.yourcomapny.com will be used to access Keep UI.

#### Certificate
Both private key (.pem) and certificate (.crt)

<Tip>
There are other ways to assign the certificate to the ingress, which are not covered by this tutorial, contributions are welcomed here, just open a PR and we will review and merge.


1. Google's Managed Certificate - if you domain is managed by Google Cloud DNS, you can spin up the ceritificate automatically using Google's Managed Certificate.
2. Using cert-manager - you can install cert-manager and use LetsEncrypt to spin up ceritificate for Keep.

</Tip>


### Add an A record for the domain to point to the frontend IP
You can get the frontend IP by:
```
frontend_ip=$(kubectl -n keep get ingress | grep frontend | awk '{ print $4 }')
```
Now go into the domain controller and add the A record that points to that IP.

<Info>At this stage, you should be able to access your Keep UI via http://keep.yourcomapny.com </Info>

### Store the certificate as kubernetes secret
Assuming the private key stored as `tls.key` and the certificate stored as `tls.crt`:

```bash
kubectl create secret tls frontend-tls --cert=./tls.crt --key=./tls.key -n keep

# you should see:
secret/frontend-tls created
```


### Upgrade Keep to use TLS

Create this `values.yaml`:
** Note to change keep.yourcomapny.com to your domain **

```yaml
namespace: keep
isGKE: true
frontend:
  ingress:
    enabled: true
    hosts:
      - host: keep.yourcompany.com
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
    tls:
      - hosts:
          - keep.yourcompany.com
        secretName: frontend-tls
  env:
    - name: NEXTAUTH_SECRET
      value: secret
    # Changed the NEXTAUTH_URL
    - name: NEXTAUTH_URL
      value: https://keep.yourcompany.com
    # https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/issues/600
    - name: VERCEL
      value: 1
    - name: API_URL
      value: http://keep-backend:8080
    - name: NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY
      value: "phc_muk9qE3TfZsX3SZ9XxX52kCGJBclrjhkP9JxAQcm1PZ"
    - name: NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST
      value: https://app.posthog.com
    - name: ENV
      value: development
    - name: NODE_ENV
      value: development
    - name: HOSTNAME
      value: 0.0.0.0
    - name: PUSHER_HOST
      value: keep-websocket.default.svc.cluster.local
    - name: PUSHER_PORT
      value: 6001
    - name: PUSHER_APP_KEY
      value: "keepappkey"

backend:
  env:
    # Added the KEEP_API_URL
    - name: KEEP_API_URL
      value: https://keep.yourcompany.com/backend
    - name: DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING
      value: mysql+pymysql://root@keep-database:3306/keep
    - name: SECRET_MANAGER_TYPE
      value: k8s
    - name: PORT
      value: "8080"
    - name: PUSHER_APP_ID
      value: 1
    - name: PUSHER_APP_KEY
      value: keepappkey
    - name: PUSHER_APP_SECRET
      value: keepappsecret
    - name: PUSHER_HOST
      value: keep-websocket
    - name: PUSHER_PORT
      value: 6001
database:
  # this is needed since o/w helm install fails. if you are using different storageClass, edit the value here.
  pvc:
    storageClass: "standard-rwo"
```

Now, update Keep:
```
helm upgrade -n keep keep keephq/keep -f values.yaml
```

### Validate everything works

First, you should be able to access Keep's UI with https now, using https://keep.yourcompany.com if that's working - you can skip the other validations.
<Info>The "Not Secure" in the screenshot is due to self-signed certificate.</Info>

<Frame>
     <img src="/images/gke2.png" />
</Frame>

#### Validate ingress host

```bash
kubectl -n keep get ingress

# You should see now the HOST underyour ingress, now with port 443:
NAME            CLASS    HOSTS                         ADDRESS         PORTS     AGE
keep-backend    <none>   *                             34.54.XXX.XXX   80        2d16h
keep-frontend   <none>   keep.yourcompany.com          34.49.XXX.XXX   80, 443   2d16h
```

#### Validate the ingress using the TLS

You should see `frontend-tls terminates keep.yourcompany.com`:

```bash
kubectl -n keep describe ingress.networking.k8s.io/keep-frontend
Name:             keep-frontend

## Uninstall Keep

### Uninstall the helm package
```bash
helm uninstall -n keep keep
```

###  Delete the namespace

```bash
kubectl delete ns keep
```
