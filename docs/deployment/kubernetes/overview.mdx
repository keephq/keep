<Tip> If you need help deploying Keep on Kubernetes or have any feedback or suggestions, feel free to open a ticket in our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/keephq/keep) or say hello in our [Slack](https://slack.keephq.dev). </Tip>


Keep is designed as a Kubernetes-native application.

We maintain an opinionated, batteries-included Helm chart, but you can customize it as needed.
