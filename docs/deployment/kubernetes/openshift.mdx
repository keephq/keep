Keep's Helm Chart also supports Openshift installation.

Simply follow the Kubernetes set-up guide, but make sure to modify the following lines under frontend(/backend).route in the values.yaml file as follows:
```
enabled: true
host: <desired-hostname>
path: <desired-path> # should be / for default
tls: <desired-tls-configs>
wildcardPolicy: <desired-wildcardPolicy>
```
