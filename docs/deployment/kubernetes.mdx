Keep can be installed via Helm Chart.

First, add the Helm repository of Keep and pull the latest version of the chart:
```
helm repo add keephq https://keephq.github.io/helm-charts
helm pull keephq/keep
```

Next, install using:
```
helm install keep keephq/keep
```

Notice for it to work locally, you'll need this port forwarding:
```
# expose the UI
kubectl port-forward svc/keep-frontend 3000:3000
```
