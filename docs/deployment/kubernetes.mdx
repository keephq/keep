## Overview

### High Level Architecture
Keep architecture composes of two main components:

1. **Keep API** (aka keep backend) - a pythonic server (FastAPI) which serves as Keep's backend
2. **Keep Frontend** - (aka keep ui) - a nextjs server which serves as Keep's frontend

Keep is also using the following (optional) components:

3. **Websocket Server** - a soketi server serves as the websocket server to allow real time updates from the server to the browser without refreshing the page
4. **Database Server** - a database which Keep reads/writes for persistency. Keep currently supports sqlite, postgres, mysql and sql server (enterprise)

### Kubernetes Architecture
Keep's Kubernetes architecture is composed of several components, each with its own set of Kubernetes resources. Here's a detailed breakdown of each component and its associated resources:

#### General Components
<Tip>Keep uses kubernetes secret manager to store secrets such as integrations credentials.</Tip>

| Kubernetes Resource | Purpose | Required/Optional | Source |

These tables provide a comprehensive overview of the Kubernetes resources used in the Keep architecture, organized by component type. Each table describes the purpose of each resource, indicates whether it's required or optional, and provides a direct link to the source template in the Keep Helm charts GitHub repository.


### Kubernetes Configuration
<Tip>This sections covers only kubernetes-specific configuration. To learn about Keep-specific configuration, controlled by environment variables, see [Keep Configuration](/deployment/configuration)</Tip>

Each of these components can be customized via the `values.yaml` file in the Helm chart.


Below are key configurations that can be adjusted for each component.

#### 1. Frontend Configuration
```yaml
frontend:
  enabled: true                 # Enable or disable the frontend deployment.
  replicaCount: 1               # Number of frontend replicas.
  image:
    repository: us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/keephq/keep/keep-ui
    pullPolicy: Always          # Image pull policy (Always, IfNotPresent).
    tag: latest
  serviceAccount:
    create: true                # Create a new service account.
    name: ""                    # Service account name (empty for default).
  podAnnotations: {}            # Annotations for frontend pods.
  podSecurityContext: {}        # Security context for the frontend pods.
  securityContext: {}           # Security context for the containers.
  service:
    type: ClusterIP              # Service type (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer).
    port: 3000                  # Port on which the frontend service is exposed.
  # Enable or disable frontend ingress.
  ingress:
    enabled: true
    hosts:
    - host: keep.yourcompany.com
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
    tls:
    - hosts:
      - keep.yourcompany.com
        secretName: frontend-tls  # Secret for TLS certificates.
```

#### 2. Backend Configuration
```yaml
backend:
  enabled: true                # Enable or disable the backend deployment.
  replicaCount: 1              # Number of backend replicas.
  image:
    repository: us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/keephq/keep/keep-api
    pullPolicy: Always         # Image pull policy (Always, IfNotPresent).
  serviceAccount:
    create: true               # Create a new service account.
    name: ""                   # Service account name (empty for default).
  podAnnotations: {}           # Annotations for backend pods.
  podSecurityContext: {}       # Security context for backend pods.
  securityContext: {}          # Security context for containers.
  service:
    type: ClusterIP      # Service type (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer).
    port: 8080           # Port on which the backend API is exposed.
  ingress:
    enabled: true         # Enable or disable backend ingress.
    hosts:
     - paths:
      - path: /
           pathType: Prefix
```

#### 3. WebSocket Server Configuration
Keep uses Soketi as its websocket server. To learn how to configure it, please see [Soketi docs](https://github.com/soketi/charts/tree/master/charts/soketi).


#### 4. Database Configuration
Keep supports plenty of database (e.g. postgresql, mysql, sqlite, etc). It is out of scope to describe here how to deploy all of them to k8s. If you have specific questions - [contact us](https://slack.keephq.dev) and we will be happy to help.



## Installation
The recommended way to install Keep in kubernetes is via Helm Chart.

First, add the Helm repository of Keep and pull the latest version of the chart:
```bash
helm repo add keephq https://keephq.github.io/helm-charts
helm pull keephq/keep
```

Next, install Keep using:
```bash

# it is always recommended to install Keep in a seperate namespace
kubectl create ns keep

helm install -n keep keep keephq/keep --set namespace=keep
```


## Expose Keep with port-forward
Notice for it to work locally, you'll need this port forwarding:
```
# expose the UI
kubectl -n keep port-forward svc/keep-frontend 3000:3000
```

## Expose Keep with ingress (HTTP)
Once you are ready to expose Keep to the outer world, Keep's helm chart comes with pre-configured ingress

```bash
kubectl -n keep get ingress
NAME            CLASS    HOSTS                         ADDRESS         PORTS     AGE
keep-backend    <none>                                 34.54.XXX.XXX    80        75m
keep-frontend   <none>                                 34.54.XXX.XXX    80        70m
```

## Expose Keep with ingress (HTTPS)

#### Prerequisites

1. Domain -e.g. keep.yourcomapny.com will be used to access Keep UI.
2. Certificate - both private key (.pem) and certificate (.crt)

#### Store the certificate as kubernetes secret
Assuming the private key stored as `tls.key` and the certificate stored as `tls.crt`:

```bash
kubectl create secret tls frontend-tls --cert=./tls.crt --key=./tls.key -n keep

# you should see:
secret/frontend-tls created
```

#### Upgrade Keep to use TLS

Create this `values.yaml`:
** Note to change keep.yourcomapny.com to your domain **

```yaml
namespace: keep
frontend:
  ingress:
    enabled: true
    hosts:
      - host: keep.yourcompany.com
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
    tls:
      - hosts:
          - keep.yourcompany.com
        secretName: frontend-tls
  env:
    - name: NEXTAUTH_SECRET
      value: secret
    # Changed the NEXTAUTH_URL
    - name: NEXTAUTH_URL
      value: https://keep.yourcompany.com
    # https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/issues/600
    - name: VERCEL
      value: 1
    - name: API_URL
      value: http://keep-backend:8080
    - name: NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY
      value: "phc_muk9qE3TfZsX3SZ9XxX52kCGJBclrjhkP9JxAQcm1PZ"
    - name: NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST
      value: https://app.posthog.com
    - name: ENV
      value: development
    - name: NODE_ENV
      value: development
    - name: HOSTNAME
      value: 0.0.0.0
    - name: PUSHER_HOST
      value: keep-websocket.default.svc.cluster.local
    - name: PUSHER_PORT
      value: 6001
    - name: PUSHER_APP_KEY
      value: "keepappkey"

backend:
  env:
    # Added the KEEP_API_URL
    - name: KEEP_API_URL
      value: https://keep.yourcompany.com/backend
    - name: DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING
      value: mysql+pymysql://root@keep-database:3306/keep
    - name: SECRET_MANAGER_TYPE
      value: k8s
    - name: PORT
      value: "8080"
    - name: PUSHER_APP_ID
      value: 1
    - name: PUSHER_APP_KEY
      value: keepappkey
    - name: PUSHER_APP_SECRET
      value: keepappsecret
    - name: PUSHER_HOST
      value: keep-websocket
    - name: PUSHER_PORT
      value: 6001
database:
  # this is needed since o/w helm install fails. if you are using different storageClass, edit the value here.
  pvc:
    storageClass: "standard-rwo"
```

Now, update Keep:
```
helm upgrade -n keep keep keephq/keep -f values.yaml
```
