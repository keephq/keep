<Tip>For any questions or issues related to provider provisioning, please join our [Slack](https://slack.keephq.dev) community.</Tip>

Provider provisioning in Keep allows you to set up and manage data providers dynamically. This feature enables you to configure various data sources that Keep can interact with, such as monitoring systems, databases, or other services.

### Configuring Providers

To provision providers and deduplication rules for them, set the `KEEP_PROVIDERS` environment variable. This can be done in two ways:
1. Directly with a JSON string containing the providers configurations.
2. With the path to a JSON file that contains the providers configurations.

<Tip>Please note: Deduplication rules are not mandatory for provider distribution. See the Clickhouse example.</Tip>

Providers provisioning JSON example:
```json
{
  "keepVictoriaMetrics": {
    "type": "victoriametrics",
    "authentication": {
      "VMAlertHost": "http://localhost",
      "VMAlertPort": 1234
    },
    "deduplication_rules": {
      "deduplication rule name example 1": {
        "description": "deduplication rule name example 1",
        "fingerprint_fields": ["fingerprint", "source", "service"],
        "full_deduplication": true,
        "ignore_fields": ["name", "lastReceived"]
      },
      "deduplication rule name example 2": {
        "description": "deduplication rule name example 2",
        "fingerprint_fields": ["fingerprint", "source", "service"],
        "full_deduplication": false,
      }
    }
  },
  "keepClickhouse1": {
    "type": "clickhouse",
    "authentication": {
      "host": "http://localhost",
      "port": 1234,
      "username": "keep",
      "password": "keep",
      "database": "keep-db"
    }
  }
}
```

Spin up Keep with this `KEEP_PROVIDERS` value:
```json
# ENV
KEEP_PROVIDERS={"keepVictoriaMetrics":{"type":"victoriametrics","authentication":{"VMAlertHost":"http://localhost","VMAlertPort": 1234}},"keepClickhouse1":{"type":"clickhouse","authentication":{"host":"http://localhost","port":"4321","username":"keep","password":"1234","database":"keepdb"}}}
```

### Supported Providers

Keep supports a wide range of provider types. Each provider type has its own specific configuration requirements.
To see the full list of supported providers and their detailed configuration options, please refer to our comprehensive provider documentation.


### Update Provisioned Providers

Provider configurations can be updated dynamically by changing the `KEEP_PROVIDERS` environment variable.

On every restart, Keep reads this environment variable and determines which providers need to be added or removed.

This process allows for flexible management of data sources without requiring manual intervention. By simply updating the `KEEP_PROVIDERS` variable and restarting the application, you can efficiently add new providers, remove existing ones, or modify their configurations.

The high-level provisioning mechanism:
1. Keep reads the `KEEP_PROVIDERS` value.
2. Keep checks if there are any provisioned providers that are no longer in the `KEEP_PROVIDERS` value, and deletes them.
3. Keep installs all providers from the `KEEP_PROVIDERS` value.
