Workflow provisioning in Keep allows you to set up and manage workflows dynamically. This feature enables you to configure various automated processes and tasks within your Keep deployment.

### Configuring Workflows

To provision workflows, follow these steps:

1. Set the `KEEP_WORKFLOWS_DIRECTORY` environment variable to the path of your workflow configuration directory.
2. Create workflow configuration files in the specified directory.

Example directory structure:
```
/path/to/workflows/
├── workflow1.yaml
├── workflow2.yaml
└── workflow3.yaml
```
### Update Provisioned Workflows

You can efficiently add new workflows, remove existing ones, or modify their configurations by simply updating the workflow files in the `KEEP_WORKFLOWS_DIRECTORY`. This process allows for flexible management of workflows without requiring manual intervention.

Workflow provisioning is done on every restart. It can also be triggered without a restart via the `/workflows/provision` endpoint of the API.

```
curl -XPOST http://localhost:8080/workflows/provision
```

Keep reads the `KEEP_WORKFLOWS_DIRECTORY` environment variable and determines which workflows need to be added, removed, or updated.

The high-level provisioning mechanism:
1. Keep reads the `KEEP_WORKFLOWS_DIRECTORY` value.
2. Keep lists all workflow files under the `KEEP_WORKFLOWS_DIRECTORY` directory.
3. Keep compares the current workflow files with the previously provisioned workflows:
   - New workflow files are provisioned.
   - Missing workflow files are deprovisioned.
   - Updated workflow files are re-provisioned with the new configuration.
4. Keep updates its internal state to reflect the current set of provisioned workflows.
