title: "Dashboard Provisioning"

Provisioning dashboards in Keep allows you to configure and manage visual representations of your data. This section will guide you through the steps required to set up and provision dashboards.

### Dashboard Provisioning Overview

Dashboards in Keep are configured using JSON strings that define the layout, data sources, and visual components. These configurations can be managed through environment variables or configuration files.

### Environment Variables

To provision dashboards, you need to set the following environment variable:

| Environment Variable | Purpose                                         |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `KEEP_DASHBOARDS`    | JSON string containing dashboard configurations |

### Example Configuration

Here is an example of how to set the `KEEP_DASHBOARDS` environment variable (dumped from the database):

```json
[
  {
    "dashboard_name": "My Dashboard",
    "dashboard_config": {
      "layout": [
