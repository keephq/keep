title: "Keycloak Authentication"
---

<Tip>Keep supports Keycloak in a "managed" way where Keep auto-provisions all resources (realm, client, etc.). Keep can also work with externally managed Keycloak. To learn how, please contact the team on [Slack](https://slack.keephq.dev).</Tip>

<Tip>This feature is a part of Keep Enterprise. Talk to us to get access: https://www.keephq.dev/meet-keep</Tip>

Keep integrates with Keycloak to provide a powerful and flexible authentication system for multi-tenant applications, supporting Single Sign-On (SSO) and SAML.
