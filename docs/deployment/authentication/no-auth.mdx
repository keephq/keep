title: "No Authentication"
---
<Warning>Using this configuration in production is not secure and strongly discouraged.</Warning>


Deploying Keep without authentication is the quickest way to get up and running, ideal for local development or internal tools where security is not a concern.
## Setup Instructions
Either if you use docker-compose, kubernetes, openshift or any other deployment method, add the following environment variable:
```
# Frontend
AUTH_TYPE=NOAUTH

# Backend
AUTH_TYPE=NOAUTH
```
## Implications
With `AUTH_TYPE=NOAUTH`:
- Keep won't show any login page and will let you consume APIs without authentication.
- Keep will use a JWT with "keep" as the tenant id, but will not validate it.
- Any API key provided in the `x-api-key` header will be accepted without validation.

This configuration essentially bypasses all authentication checks, making it unsuitable for production environments where security is a concern.
