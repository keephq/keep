# ❓ What is a Condition

#### predefined rule that define when an alert should be triggered
 An alert condition is a predefined rule or set of rules that define when an alert should be triggered. An alert condition typically consists of a specific event, threshold or set of criteria that must be met to trigger the alert. For example, an alert condition for a server could be a CPU usage percentage that exceeds a certain threshold or a website response time that is slower than a specific duration. When the defined conditions are met, an alert is triggered, and notifications are sent to the relevant stakeholders. Alert conditions are commonly used in monitoring systems to detect and notify on potential issues before they escalate.
