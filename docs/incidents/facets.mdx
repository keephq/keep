Faceted search is a powerful mechanism for enhancing search functionality, allowing users to filter and refine search results dynamically using multiple dimensions or "facets." These facets are predefined categories or attributes of the data. In Keep, the Incidents page supports faceted search by incident attributes.

### Predefined Incident Facets
These are predefined Incident facets that can be used to filter incidents:
- **Status**: Filter by Incident status
- **Severity**: Filter by Incident severity
- **Assignee**: Filter by Incident assignee
- **Source**: Filter by alert source
- **Service**: Filter by the service the Incident relates to

### Custom Facets Creation
Keep also supports custom facets creation. Here is how to do this:
1. Click the "Add facet" button in the filtering panel.
2. Enter the Facet name. This is the name that will be displayed in the filter panel.
3. Enter the Facet property path the facet will filter by.
4. Click "Create".
