# QuickChart Provider

## Overview

The QuickChart provider allows for the generation of two types of charts based on alert data within Keep's platform:

1. A line chart that shows the trend of a specific fingerprint alert over time.
2. A radial gauge chart displaying the total number of alerts Keep received for this fingerprint.

These charts can be used in various reports, dashboards, or alert summaries to provide visual insights into alert activity and trends.
