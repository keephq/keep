<Tip>
  Mailgun currently supports receiving alerts via email. We will add querying
  and notifying soon.
</Tip>

## Inputs

Mailgun Provider does not currently support the `notify` function.

## Outputs

Mailgun Provider does not currently support the `query` function.

## Authentication Parameters

The Mailgun Provider uses API token authentication. You need to provide the following authentication parameters to connect to Mailgun:

- **email** (optional): Email address to send alerts to. This will get populated automatically after installation.
- **sender** (optional): Sender email address to validate. For example, `.*@keephq.dev`. Leave empty for any.
- **extraction** (optional): Extraction Rules. Read more about extraction in Keep's Mailgun documentation.

## Connecting with the Provider

To connect to Mailgun, you do not need to perform any actions on the Mailgun side. We use our own Mailgun account and handle everything for you.

## Post Installation Validation

You can check that the Mailgun Provider works by sending a test email to the configured email address.

1. Send a test email to the email address provided in the `authentication` section.
2. Check Keep's platform to see if the alert is received.

## Default Alert Values

When no extraction rules are set, the default values for every alert are as follows:

- **name**: The subject of the email.
- **source**: The sender of the email.
- **message**: The stripped text content of the email.
- **timestamp**: The timestamp of the email, converted to ISO format.
- **severity**: "info"
- **status**: "firing"

## How Extraction Works

Extraction rules allow you to extract specific information from the email content using regular expressions. This can be useful for parsing and structuring the alert data.

### Example Extraction Rule

An extraction rule is defined as a dictionary with the following keys:

- **key**: The key in the email event to apply the extraction rule to.
- **value**: The regular expression to use for extraction.

#### Example

Extract the severity from the subject of the email.

```
Key: subject
Value: (?P<severity>\w+):
```
