## Connecting with the Provider

1. Set up a Kafka broker (or use an existing one) and make sure it is accessible.
2. Get the broker URL (e.g., `localhost:9092` or a remote Kafka service URL).
3. (Optional) If using secure communication, provide the security protocol, SASL mechanism, username, and password.
4. Configure the provider with these parameters.
