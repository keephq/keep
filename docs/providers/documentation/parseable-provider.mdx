## Inputs

- `script`: str : Bash script to execute

## Outputs

- `result`: The output of the executed Bash script

## Authentication Parameters

_None required for local execution._

## Limitations

- The Bash provider is currently **disabled for cloud execution** due to security concerns regarding script execution in a cloud environment. It is recommended to use this provider locally or in a controlled environment.

## Connecting with the Provider

The Bash provider allows you to run Bash scripts as actions. Ensure you have the necessary permissions to execute scripts in your environment.

## Example of usage

```yaml
workflow:
  id: bash-example
  description: Bash example
  triggers:
    - type: manual
  actions:
    - name: bash
      provider:
        type: bash
        config: "{{ providers.bashtest }}"
        with:
          script: |
            echo "Hello, world!"
