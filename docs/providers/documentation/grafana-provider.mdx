description: "Grafana Provider allows either pull/push alerts from Grafana to Keep."

<Tip>Grafana currently supports pulling/pushing alerts. We will add querying and notifying soon.</Tip>

## Inputs

Grafana Provider does not currently support the `notify` function.

## Outputs

Grafana Provider does not currently support the `query` function.

## Authentication Parameters

The Grafana Provider uses API token authentication. You need to provide the following authentication parameters to connect to Grafana:

- **token** (required): Your Grafana API Token.
- **host** (required): The URL of your Grafana host (e.g., https://keephq.grafana.net).

## Connecting with the Provider

To connect to Grafana, you need to create an API Token:

1. Log in to your Grafana account.
2. Go to the **Service Accounts** page (cmd+k -> service).
3. Click the **Add service account** button and provide a name for your service account.
4. Grant "alerting" permissions:

</Frame>

5. Now generate Service Account Token:

</Frame>
6. Use the token value in the `authentication` section in the Grafana Provider configuration.

## Post Installation Validation

You can check that the Grafana Provider works by testing Keep's contact point (which was installed via the webhook integration).

1. Go to **Contact Points** (cmd k -> contact).
2. Find the **keep-grafana-webhook-integration**:

  height="200">
  <img height="10" src="/images/grafana_sa_3.png" />
</Frame>
3. Click on the **View contact point**:

<Frame
    width="100"
  height="200">
  <img height="10" src="/images/grafana_sa_4.png" />
</Frame>
4. Click on **Test**:

<Frame
    width="100"
  height="200">
  <img height="10" src="/images/grafana_sa_5.png" />
</Frame>
5. Go to Keep – you should see an alert from Grafana!

**Alternative Validation Methods (When Keep is Not Accessible Externally):**

If Keep is not accessible externally and the webhook cannot be created, you can manually validate the Grafana provider setup using the following methods:

1. **Manual Test Alerts in Grafana:**
   - Create a manual test alert in Grafana.
   - Set up a contact point within Grafana that would normally send alerts to Keep.
   - Trigger the alert and check Grafana's logs for errors or confirmation that the alert was sent.

2. **Check Logs in Grafana:**
   - Access Grafana’s log files or use the **Explore** feature to query logs related to the alerting mechanism.
   - Ensure there are no errors related to the webhook integration and that alerts are processed correctly.

3. **Verify Integration Status:**
   - Navigate to the **Alerting** section in Grafana.
   - Confirm that the integration status shows as active or functioning.
   - Monitor any outbound HTTP requests to verify that Grafana is attempting to communicate with Keep.

4. **Network and Connectivity Check:**
   - Use network monitoring tools to ensure Grafana can reach Keep or any alternative endpoint configured for alerts.

## Webhook Integration Modifications

The webhook integration adds Keep as a contact point in the Grafana instance. This integration can be located under the "Contact Points" section. Keep also gains access to the following scopes:
- `alert.provisioning:read`
- `alert.provisioning:write`
