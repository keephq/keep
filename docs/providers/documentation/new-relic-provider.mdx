## Connecting with the Provider

1. Go to https://one.newrelic.com/admin-portal/api-keys/home to create User Key.
2. Get `api_key` and `account_id` from the key created.
3. Based on region get `api_url` from here https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/get-started/introduction-new-relic-rest-api-v2 .

## Webhook Integration Modifications

The webhook integration adds Keep as a destination within the "Alerts and AI" API within New Relic.
This grants Keep access to the following scopes within New Relic:
- `ai.destinations:read`
- `ai.destinations:write`
- `ai.channels:read`
- `ai.channels:write`
