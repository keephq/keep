### Organization Slug

You can find the Organization Slug in your Sentry URL.
For example, this is our playground account: `https://keep-dr.sentry.io/` - The organization slug is `keep-dr`.

To obtain the Organization Slug from the settings page:

1. Log in to your Sentry account.
2. Navigate `Settings` -> `General Settings`.
3. Copy the Organization Slug from the Organization Slug input.

## Notes

<Note>
When installing Sentry webhook integration, Keep enables built-in Webhook integration to all accessible projects and adds a new Alert that has an `Action` to send a notification via Webhooks to all accessible projects.

You can achieve alerts pushing from Sentry to Keep using an `Internal Integration` which is not automated via the platform. [Contact us](mailto:founder@keephq.dev) to set it up.
