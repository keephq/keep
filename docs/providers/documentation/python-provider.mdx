## Inputs

- `script`: str: Python script to execute

## Outputs

- `result`: The output of the Python script

## Authentication Parameters

_None required for local execution._

## Limitations

- The Python provider is currently disabled for cloud execution. This means that Python scripts cannot be executed in a cloud environment.
- Users must ensure that the scripts are compatible with the local execution environment.

## Connecting with the Provider

The Python provider allows you to run small Python scripts. 

## Example of usage

```yaml
workflow:
  id: python-example
  description: Python example
  triggers:
    - type: manual
  actions:
    - name: python
      provider:
        type: python
        config: "{{ providers.pythontest }}"
        with:
          script: |
            print("Hello, world!")
