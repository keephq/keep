## Connecting with the Provider

Obtain Splunk API Token:
1. Ensure you have a Splunk account with the necessary [permissions](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/9.2.0/Security/Rolesandcapabilities). The basic permissions required are `list_all_objects` & `edit_own_objects`.
2. Get an API token for authenticating API requests. [Read More](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/9.2.0/Security/Setupauthenticationwithtokens) on how to set up and get API Keys.

Identify Your Splunk Instance Details:
1. Determine the Host (IP address or hostname) and Port (default is 8089 for Splunk's management API) of the Splunk instance you wish to connect to.
