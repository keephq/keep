## Email Format Support

The SMTP provider supports two email formats:

### Plain Text Emails
Use the `body` parameter to send plain text emails:
```yaml
with:
  from_email: "sender@example.com"
  from_name: "Keep Alerts"
  to_email: "recipient@example.com"
  subject: "Alert Notification"
  body: "This is a plain text email notification."
```

### HTML Emails
Use the `html` parameter to send HTML-formatted emails:
```yaml
with:
  from_email: "sender@example.com"
  from_name: "Keep Alerts"
  to_email: "recipient@example.com"
  subject: "Alert Notification"
  html: "<h1>Alert</h1><p>This is an <strong>HTML</strong> email notification.</p>"
```

When both `body` and `html` are provided, the HTML content takes precedence.

## Multiple Recipients

You can send emails to multiple recipients by providing a list of email addresses:
```yaml
with:
  to_email:
    - "recipient1@example.com"
    - "recipient2@example.com"
    - "recipient3@example.com"
```
