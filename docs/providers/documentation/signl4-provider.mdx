## Connecting with the Provider

To use the Signl4Provider, you'll need to provide your signl4_integration_secret.

You can find your integration or team secret in the SIGNL4 web portal under **Teams** or **Integrations** -> **Distribution Rules**.

The signl4_integration_secret is used to post events to SIGNL4 using the webhook API.

## Notes

The provider uses either the events API or the incidents API to create an alert or an incident. The choice of API to use is determined by the presence of either a routing_key or an api_key.
