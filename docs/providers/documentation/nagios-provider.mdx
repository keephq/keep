## Connecting with the Provider

### Option 1: Pull-based (Nagios XI API)

1. You need a Nagios XI instance with API access enabled.
2. Go to **Admin > Manage API Keys** and create a new API key.
3. Use the Nagios XI URL and the API key to configure the provider.

### Option 2: Push-based (Webhook)

1. Configure a notification command in Nagios that sends HTTP POST requests to Keep.
2. Assign the command to a contact and configure notification rules.
3. See the webhook setup instructions in the provider configuration for details.
