## Overview

The Nagios provider enables integration between Keep and Nagios XI. It allows you to pull host and service alerts from your Nagios monitoring system, making it easier to manage infrastructure and application monitoring in one place.

## Connecting Nagios to Keep

To connect Nagios XI to Keep, you need to configure the provider with your Nagios server details and API credentials.

### Prerequisites

- Nagios XI installation with API access enabled
- Valid Nagios XI API key

### Setup Steps

1. **Generate API Key in Nagios XI:**
   - Log in to your Nagios XI web interface
   - Navigate to **Admin** > **System Config** > **API Keys**
   - Click **Add New** to create a new API key
   - Copy the generated API key

2. **Configure the Provider in Keep:**
   - Navigate to the Keep providers page
   - Add a new Nagios provider
   - Enter your Nagios server URL (e.g., `https://nagios.example.com`)
   - Paste the API key you generated
   - Optionally disable SSL verification if using self-signed certificates

3. **Test the Connection:**
   - Save the provider configuration
   - Keep will automatically fetch active alerts from your Nagios server

## Features

The Nagios provider supports:

- **Host Alerts**: Fetch alerts for DOWN, UNREACHABLE hosts
- **Service Alerts**: Fetch alerts for WARNING, CRITICAL, UNKNOWN services
- **Alert Status Mapping**: Automatically maps Nagios states to Keep statuses (FIRING, RESOLVED, ACKNOWLEDGED)
- **Severity Mapping**: Maps Nagios severity levels to Keep severity levels

## Alert Mapping

### Severity Mapping

| Nagios State | Keep Severity |
|--------------|---------------|
| OK / UP      | INFO          |
| WARNING      | WARNING       |
| CRITICAL / DOWN | CRITICAL   |
| UNKNOWN / UNREACHABLE | INFO |

### Status Mapping

| Nagios State | Keep Status |
|--------------|-------------|
| OK / UP      | RESOLVED    |
| WARNING      | FIRING      |
| CRITICAL / DOWN | FIRING   |
| UNKNOWN      | FIRING      |

Acknowledged alerts in Nagios will show as **ACKNOWLEDGED** in Keep.

## Fingerprinting

Alerts are uniquely identified using a combination of:
- `host_name`: The hostname from Nagios
- `service_description`: The service name (for service alerts)

This ensures that the same alert from Nagios is properly deduplicated in Keep.

## API Endpoints Used

The provider fetches data from the following Nagios XI API endpoints:

- `/api/v1/objects/hoststatus` - Retrieves current host status information
- `/api/v1/objects/servicestatus` - Retrieves current service status information
