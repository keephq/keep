## Connecting with the Provider

To connect to the provider, you can instantiate an instance of the `HttpProvider` class, providing a `provider_id` and a `ProviderConfig` object. Then you can call the `query` method to query the HTTP endpoint.

## Notes

The code logs some debug information about the requests being sent, including the request headers, body, and query parameters. This information should not contain sensitive information, but it's important to make sure of that before using this provider in production.
