## Connecting with the Provider

To connect to Azure AKS, follow below steps:

1. Log in to your [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) account.
2. Go to your kubernetes service page and click on `Connect` button and then click on `Open Cloud Shell`.
3. Run `az ad sp create-for-rbac --role owner --scopes /subscriptions/<YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID>` in the cloud shell, you will get response similar to:
   ```
    {
      "appId": "xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxx",
      "displayName": "azure-cli-2023-11-06-13-00-52",
      "password": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
      "tenant": "xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxxx"
    }
   ```
   In above JSON object, the `appId` is `client_id`, `password` is `client_secret` and `tenant` is `tenant_id`
