## Overview

Falco is an open-source runtime security project that detects unexpected behavior and sends alerts.
Using the Falco provider you can forward these alerts to Keep for further processing and correlation.

## Connecting Falco to Keep

1. Enable the [`http_output`](https://falco.org/docs/usage/http_output/) option or configure [falcosidekick](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falcosidekick).
2. Set the webhook URL to `https://api.keephq.dev/alerts/event/falco`.
3. Provide your Keep API key using the `X-API-KEY` header.

Once configured, Falco will start sending alerts to Keep where you can view and manage them.
