## Inputs

- `alert_message`: str: The message to display in the alert
- `severity`: str (optional): The severity level of the alert (e.g., `low`, `medium`, `high`)

## Outputs

_No outputs as this is a placeholder provider._

## Authentication Parameters

_None required for the Keep provider, as it acts as a placeholder for non-provider alerts._

## Connecting with the Provider

The Keep provider does not connect to any external service. It serves as a placeholder for cases where alerts do not need a specific provider.

## Example of usage

```yaml
workflow:
  id: keep-provider-example
  description: Keep Provider example
  triggers:
    - type: manual
  actions:
    - name: keep-alert
      provider:
        type: keep
        config: "{{ providers.keep }}"
        with:
          alert_message: "This is a placeholder alert."
          severity: "low"
