The PRTG Provider enables Keep to receive alerts from PRTG Network Monitor via webhooks. This allows you to centralize your PRTG alerts in Keep for better incident management.

## Connecting PRTG to Keep

### Setup Webhook in PRTG

1. In PRTG web interface, go to **Setup** → **Notifications**.

2. Click **Add new notification**.

3. Set a name (e.g., "Send to Keep").

4. Enable **Execute HTTP Action**.

5. Configure the webhook:
   - **URL**: `https://api.keephq.dev/alerts/event/prtg`
   - **Method**: `POST`
   - **Content Type**: `application/json`

6. In the **Payload** field, use the following template:

```json

  "device": "%device",
  "group": "%group",
  "status": "%status",

  "device_id": "%deviceid",
  "group_id": "%groupid",
  "priority": "%priority",
  "lastvalue": "%lastvalue",
