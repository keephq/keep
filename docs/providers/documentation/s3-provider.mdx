## Inputs

- `bucket`: str : The bucket to read the files from.

## Limitations

Querying only yaml, yml, json, xml and csv files.

## Outputs

Please note that during the installation, the provider is performing `list_buckets` to validate the config. Here is an example IAM policy:
```
{
	"Version": "2025-01-15",
	"Statement": [
		{
			"Sid": "VisualEditor0",
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Action": [
				"s3:ListBucket",
				"s3:GetObject",
				"s3:GetBucketLocation",
				"s3:ListAllMyBuckets"
			],
			"Resource": "*"
		}
	]
}
```

## Example of usage


```

  - name: s3-dump
    provider:
      config: '{{ providers.s3 }}'
      type: s3
      with:
        bucket: "keep-workflows"
```
