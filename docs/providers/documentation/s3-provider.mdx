## Limitations

Querying only yaml, yml, json, xml and csv files.

## Scopes

Please note that during the installation, the provider is performing `list_buckets` to validate the config. Here is an example IAM policy:
```
{
	"Version": "2025-01-15",
	"Statement": [
		{
			"Sid": "VisualEditor0",
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Action": [
				"s3:ListBucket",
				"s3:GetObject",
				"s3:GetBucketLocation",
				"s3:ListAllMyBuckets"
			],
			"Resource": "*"
		}
	]
}
```
