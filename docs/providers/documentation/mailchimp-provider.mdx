2. Configure the Mailchimp provider in your system with the obtained API key.
3. Use the following YAML example to send an email notification using the Mailchimp provider:

  actions:
    - name: send-email
      provider:
        type: mailchimp
        config: "{{ providers.mailchimp-provider }}"
        with:
          _from: "sender@example.com"
          to: "recipient@example.com"
