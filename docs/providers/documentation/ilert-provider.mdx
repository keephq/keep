## Overview

The ilert provider facilitates interaction with ilertâ€™s API, allowing for the management of incidents and events. This includes the ability to create, update, and resolve incidents, as well as send custom event notifications. This provider integrates Keep's system with ilert's robust alerting and incident management platform.

## Inputs

The `_type` parameter specifies the nature of the notification or action to be taken via the ilert API:

- `incident`: This type is used for creating or updating incidents. It requires specific information such as incident summary, status, message, and details about affected services.
- `event`: This type allows for sending customized event notifications that can be configured to alert, accept, or resolve specific conditions. It supports details such as event type, summary, details about the event, custom details, and links for more context.

Depending on the `_type` specified, the provider will route the operation to the appropriate endpoint and handle the data according to ilert's requirements for incidents or events.

### Incident Management

- `summary`: A brief summary of the incident. This is required for creating a new incident.
- `status`: `IlertIncidentStatus` - The current status of the incident (e.g., INVESTIGATING, RESOLVED, MONITORING, IDENTIFIED).
- `message`: A detailed message describing the incident or situation. Default is an empty string.
- `affectedServices`: A JSON string representing the list of affected services and their statuses. Default is an empty array (`"[]"`).
- `id`: The ID of the incident to update. If set to `"0"`, a new incident will be created.

### Event Notification

- `event_type`: Type of the event to post (`ALERT`, `ACCEPT`, `RESOLVE`).
- `details`: Detailed information about the event.
- `alert_key`: A unique key for the event to allow de-duplication.
- `priority`: Priority level of the event (`HIGH`, `LOW`).
- `images`: List of image URLs to include with the event.
- `links`: List of related links to include with the event.
- `custom_details`: Custom key-value pairs to provide additional context.
- `routing_key`: Routing key for the event to direct it to specific recipients.

## Outputs

Responses from ilert's API are JSON objects that include the status of the operation and any relevant incident or event details.

## Authentication Parameters

- `ilert_token`: API token for authenticating with ilert's API.
- `ilert_host`: API host URL. Default is `https://api.ilert.com/api`.

## Scopes

- `read_permission`: Mandatory for validating the API token's read capabilities.
- `write_permission`: Optional for write capabilities, validated upon use.

### Event Endpoint
