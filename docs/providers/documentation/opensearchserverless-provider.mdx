## Overview

The OpenSearch Provider offers native integration with **Amazon OpenSearch Serverless**, allowing Keep users to query, monitor, and write documents in real-time. This supports observability and event-driven alerting for operational and security use cases.

### Key Features:

- **Read & Write Support**: Enables both querying and writing documents to OpenSearch Serverless collections.
- **AWS IAM Authentication**: Authenticates using AWS IAM credentials (access key/secret or instance role).

## Connecting with the Provider

To connect OpenSearch with Keep, you’ll need:

- An AWS account with permissions for OpenSearch Serverless (AOSS).
- A configured collection and index in AOSS.
- AWS IAM credentials (permanent or temporary).

## Required AWS IAM Permissions (Scopes)

To function properly, the OpenSearch provider requires the following IAM scopes:

### Mandatory Scopes

- **`aoss:ReadDocument`**
  - **Description**: Required to read documents from an OpenSearch collection.
  - **Documentation**: [AOSS API Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/serverless-genref.html#serverless-operations)
  - **Alias**: Read Documents
  - **Mandatory**: Yes

- **`aoss:WriteDocument`**
  - **Description**: Required to index or update documents in an OpenSearch collection.
  - **Documentation**: [AOSS API Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/serverless-genref.html#serverless-operations)
  - **Alias**: Write Documents
  - **Mandatory**: Yes


## Authentication Configuration

To authenticate with OpenSearch Serverless, provide the following:

- **AWS Access Key** (Mandatory): Your AWS access key.
- **AWS Access Key Secret** (Mandatory): Your AWS access key secret.
- **Region** (Mandatory): The AWS region hosting your OpenSearch collection.
- **Domain Endpoint** (Mandatory): The full domain URL of your AOSS collection endpoint.


## Setting Up the Integration
### Steps:

1. **Assign IAM Permissions**: Grant your IAM user/role `aoss:ReadDocument` and `aoss:WriteDocument` on the target collection.
2. **Configure Keep Provider**: Provide access key, secret, region, and collection endpoint in the Keep platform.

## Querying OpenSearch

Keep supports standard OpenSearch queries using the `_search` endpoint:
- **index**: The name of the OpenSearch index to query.
- **query**: A valid OpenSearch query DSL object.

### Example

```json
{
  "query": {
    "match_all": {}
  },
  "size": 1
}
```

You can use the `_notify` functionality to push documents into OpenSearch collections.
- **index**: The index name where the document should be written.
- **document**: A Python dictionary representing the document body.
- **id**: ID for the document
