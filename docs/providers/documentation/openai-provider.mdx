## Connecting with the Provider

To connect to OpenAI, you'll need to obtain an API Key and (optionally) an Organization ID:

1. Log in to your OpenAI account at [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com).
2. Go to the **API Keys** section.
3. Click on **Create new secret key** to generate a key for Keep.
4. (Optional) Retrieve your **Organization ID** under **Organization settings** if youâ€™re part of multiple organizations.

Use the generated API key in the `authentication` section of your OpenAI Provider configuration.
