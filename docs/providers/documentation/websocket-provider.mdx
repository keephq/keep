## Outputs
The `query` function of `WebsocketProvider` outputs the following format:

```json
{
  "connection": true,
  "data": "Received data from the websocket"
}
```

The `connection` field indicates whether the websocket connection was successful (`true`) or not (`false`). The `data` field contains the received data from the websocket.
If the `connection` field indicates unsuccessful connection (`false`) then the object will also include an `error` field with details about the failed connection.


## Authentication Parameters
The Websocket provider does not require any specific authentication parameters.

## Connecting with the Provider
To connect with the Websocket provider and perform queries, follow these steps:

Initialize the provider and provider configuration in your system.
Use the query function of the WebsocketProvider to interact with the websocket.
