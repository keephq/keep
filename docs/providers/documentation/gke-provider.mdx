## Connecting with the Provider

1. Obtain Google Cloud credentials by following the steps in [Google Cloud's service account guide](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys).
2. Ensure your service account has the necessary permissions to manage GKE clusters (`roles/container.admin`).
3. Provide the `gcp_credentials`, `project_id`, and `zone` in your provider configuration.
