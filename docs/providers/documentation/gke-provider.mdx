## Inputs

- `cluster_name`: str : The name of the GKE cluster to manage
- `action`: str : The action to perform on the cluster (e.g., `create`, `delete`, `scale`)
- `node_count`: int (optional) : The number of nodes (used in scaling the cluster)

## Outputs

- `status`: The status of the action performed on the GKE cluster, returned as a response message.

## Authentication Parameters

- `gcp_credentials`: JSON containing Google Cloud credentials with the necessary permissions to manage GKE clusters.
- `project_id`: Google Cloud project ID where the GKE cluster is deployed.
- `zone`: The zone where the GKE cluster is hosted.

## Connecting with the Provider

1. Obtain Google Cloud credentials by following the steps in [Google Cloud's service account guide](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys).
2. Ensure your service account has the necessary permissions to manage GKE clusters (`roles/container.admin`).
3. Provide the `gcp_credentials`, `project_id`, and `zone` in your provider configuration.

## Example of usage

```yaml
workflow:
  id: gke-example
  description: GKE example
  triggers:
    - type: manual
  actions:
    - name: gke
      provider:
        type: gke
        config: "{{ providers.gketest }}"
        with:
