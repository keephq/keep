## Inputs

- `client_id`: str : The client ID for the Auth0 application.
- `client_secret`: str : The client secret for the Auth0 application.
- `audience`: str : The audience for the API authorization request.
- `grant_type`: str : The type of authorization grant requested (e.g., `client_credentials`).

## Outputs

- `access_token`: The access token issued by Auth0 for authenticated requests.
- `expires_in`: The time in seconds before the access token expires.
- `token_type`: The type of token, typically `Bearer`.

## Authentication Parameters

To authenticate with Auth0, the following parameters are needed:
- **client_id**: The unique identifier for your Auth0 application.
- **client_secret**: A secret associated with your application, used for secure communication.
- **audience**: Defines the API resources you're trying to access.

These parameters can be retrieved from your Auth0 dashboard under the application's settings.

## Connecting with the Provider

The Auth0 provider connects to both the **Authentication API** and the **Management API**, enabling functionality such as token-based authentication and user management. Depending on your needs, you can:
- Use the **Authentication API** to obtain access tokens, manage user profiles, or handle multi-factor authentication.
- Use the **Management API** to automate the configuration of your Auth0 environment, register applications, manage users, and more.

## Example of usage

```yaml
workflow:
  id: auth0-example
  description: Auth0 example
  triggers:
    - type: manual
  actions:
    - name: auth0
      provider:
        type: auth0
        config: "{{ providers.auth0config }}"
        with:
          client_id: "{{ secrets.auth0_client_id }}"
          client_secret: "{{ secrets.auth0_client_secret }}"
          audience: "https://api.example.com"
          grant_type: "client_credentials"
