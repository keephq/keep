## Connecting with the Provider

The Auth0 provider connects to both the **Authentication API** and the **Management API**, enabling functionality such as token-based authentication and user management. Depending on your needs, you can:
- Use the **Authentication API** to obtain access tokens, manage user profiles, or handle multi-factor authentication.
- Use the **Management API** to automate the configuration of your Auth0 environment, register applications, manage users, and more.
