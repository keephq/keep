## Connecting with the Provider

In order to connect to the MySQL database, you will need to create a new user with the required permissions. Here's how you can do this:

1. Connect to the MySQL server as a user with sufficient privileges to create a new user.
2. Run the following command to create a new user:
   `CREATE USER '<username>'@'<host>' IDENTIFIED BY '<password>'`;
3. Grant the necessary permissions to the new user by running the following command:
   `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON <database>.* TO '<username>'@'<host>'`;
