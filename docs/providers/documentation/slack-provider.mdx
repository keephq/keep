## Overview

Keep's Slack integration enables seamless communication by allowing you to send notifications to Slack. This integration is designed to streamline your processes, ensuring your team remains informed with real-time updates.

### Key Features

- **Direct Notifications**: Utilize Keep to send messages directly to your Slack channels.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Easily configure alerts based on specific triggers within your Keep workflows.
- **Interactive Messages**: Enhance your Slack messages with interactive components like buttons and inputs.

## Getting Started

## Authentication Methods

Keep's Slack integration supports two primary authentication methods:

- **Webhook URL**: For simple notifications, use the webhook URL associated with your Slack channel.
- **OAuth 2.0**: For a more integrated experience, authorize Keep using Slack's OAuth 2.0 flow. This method is particularly useful for applications requiring access to more Slack features.

### Installation

1. **Add to Slack**: Begin by clicking the "Add to Slack" button on this page. You'll be guided through the OAuth authorization process to connect Keep with your Slack workspace.

2. **Installation Confirmation**: After adding Keep to Slack, you'll be redirected to a confirmation page. This page will confirm the successful installation and provide the next steps to fully leverage Slack notifications within your Keep workflows.
