# Linked Providers

In Keep, providers can be either "connected" or "linked". Understanding the difference is important for proper alert routing and management.

## Connected vs Linked Providers

- **Connected Providers**: These are providers that have been explicitly configured in Keep through the UI or API. They have full provider configuration and authentication details.

- **Linked Providers**: These are providers that send alerts to Keep without being explicitly connected. They appear automatically when Keep receives alerts from them through webhooks or push mechanisms.

## How Linking Works

When Keep receives alerts from an unconnected provider (like Prometheus pushing alerts), it automatically creates a "linked" provider entry. This allows you to:

- Track which systems are sending alerts
- See when the last alert was received
- Apply deduplication rules specific to that provider

## Attaching Alerts to Connected Providers

If you have a connected provider and want incoming alerts to be associated with it instead of creating a linked provider, you can add the `provider_id` query parameter to the webhook URL.

For example, with Prometheus AlertManager:

```yaml
alertmanager:
config:
receivers:
name: "keep"
webhook_configs:
url: "https://api.keephq.dev/alerts/prometheus?provider_id=your_provider_id"
```

## Best Practices

1. **For Production Systems**: It's recommended to use connected providers when possible, as they provide:

   - Better authentication and security
   - Access to provider-specific features
   - Clearer audit trail

2. **For Testing/Development**: Linked providers can be useful for:

   - Quick prototyping
   - Testing alert flows
   - Temporary integrations

3. **Converting Linked to Connected**: If you find yourself regularly receiving alerts from a linked provider, consider:
   - Setting up a proper provider connection
   - Using the provider_id parameter to attach alerts to the connected provider

## Limitations

Linked providers:

- Cannot be used to pull alerts or data
- Don't have authentication details
- Cannot be used for provider-specific actions
- May have limited deduplication capabilities

For full functionality, consider converting linked providers to connected providers when they become part of your permanent alerting infrastructure.
