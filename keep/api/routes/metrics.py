    This endpoint is used by Prometheus to scrape such metrics from the application:
    - alerts_total {incident_name, incident_id} - The total number of alerts per incident.
    - open_incidents_total - The total number of open incidents

    Please note that those metrics are per-tenant and are not designed to be used for the monitoring of the application itself.

    Example prometheus configuration:
    ```
    scrape_configs:
    - job_name: "scrape_keep"
      scrape_interval: 5m  # It's important to scrape not too often to avoid rate limiting.
      static_configs:
      - targets: ["https://api.keephq.dev"]  # Or your own domain.
      authorization:
        type: Bearer
        credentials: "{Your API Key}"

      # Optional, you can add labels to exported incidents. 
      # Label values will be equal to the last incident's alert payload value matching the label.
      # Attention! Don't add "flaky" labels which could change from alert to alert within the same incident.
      # Good labels: ['labels.department', 'labels.team'], bad labels: ['labels.severity', 'labels.pod_id']
      # Check Keep -> Feed -> "extraPayload" column, it will help in writing labels.

      params:
        labels: ['labels.service', 'labels.queue']
      # Will resuld as: "labels_service" and "labels_queue".
    ```
