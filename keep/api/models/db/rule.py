# Currently a rule_definition is a list of SQL expressions
# We use querybuilder for that


# TODOs/Pitfalls down the road which we hopefully need to address in the future:
# 1. nested attibtues (event.foo.bar = 1)
# 2. scale - when event arrives, we need to check if the rule is applicable to the event
#            the naive approach is to iterate over all rules and check if the rule is applicable
#            which won't scale.
# 3. action - currently support create alert, down the road should support workflows
# 4. timeframe - should be per definition group
