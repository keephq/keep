# Test Fixes Summary for PR #5002

## Issues Identified

The E2E tests were failing with the following errors:
1. **test_theme** - `Page.wait_for_selector: Timeout 5000ms exceeded` waiting for `[data-testid="settings-panel"]`
2. **test_multi_sort_asc_dsc** - `Locator.type: Timeout 5000ms exceeded` waiting for settings panel input
3. **test_backend_column_configuration_persistence** - `AssertionError: Locator expected to be visible` for settings panel

## Root Cause Analysis

The tests were failing because:
1. Tests were trying to click the settings button before the page/table was fully loaded
2. No proper wait conditions for UI elements to be rendered
3. Missing imports for Playwright's `expect` function
4. Tests were not waiting for the alerts table to be visible before accessing settings

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Backend Column Configuration Implementation
- Added `STATIC_PRESET_IDS` constant to properly identify static presets
- Fixed import to use `STATIC_PRESET_IDS` from constants instead of local definition
- Created E2E test file for backend column configuration persistence
- Ensured Tag interface is properly exported

### 2. Test Timing Issues Fixed

#### test_multi_sort_asc_dsc
- Added wait for page load state (`networkidle`)
- Added wait for settings button to be visible before clicking
- Added timeout for settings panel visibility after click
- Added wait for alerts table to be visible

#### test_backend_column_configuration_persistence  
- Added wait for alerts table and facets panel after navigation
- Added wait for table to be rendered before accessing settings
- Added proper timeout handling

#### test_theme
- Added wait for alerts table to be loaded first
- Changed to wait for settings button visibility before clicking
- Added timeout for UI stabilization

### 3. Import Fixes
- Added `from playwright.sync_api import expect` to test files that were missing it

## Files Modified

1. `/workspace/keep-ui/entities/presets/model/constants.ts` - Added STATIC_PRESET_IDS
2. `/workspace/keep-ui/entities/presets/model/usePresetColumnState.ts` - Fixed import
3. `/workspace/tests/e2e/test_backend_column_configuration_persistence.py` - Created new test
4. `/workspace/tests/e2e_tests/incidents_alerts_tests/test_filtering_sort_search_on_alerts.py` - Fixed timing issues
5. `/workspace/tests/e2e_tests/test_end_to_end_theme.py` - Fixed timing issues

## Monitoring Scripts Created

1. `monitor_pr_5002.py` - Main monitoring system that runs every 10 seconds
2. `monitor_column_config.py` - Specific checks for column configuration issues  
3. `fix_test_timing_issues.py` - Script to fix timing issues in tests
4. `fix_test_wait_for_table.py` - Script to ensure tests wait for table

## Key Improvements

1. **Proper Wait Conditions**: Tests now wait for UI elements to be rendered before interacting
2. **Table Load Verification**: Tests wait for `[data-testid='alerts-table']` before accessing settings
3. **Timeout Handling**: Increased timeouts from 5s to 10s for critical operations
4. **State Management**: Fixed column configuration to preserve all settings on updates
5. **Static Preset Detection**: Properly identifies static presets to avoid backend operations

## Expected Outcome

With these fixes, the tests should now:
- Wait properly for UI elements to load
- Handle timing issues gracefully
- Pass consistently in the CI/CD pipeline

The monitoring system will continue to check for issues every 10 seconds and attempt automatic fixes where possible.
